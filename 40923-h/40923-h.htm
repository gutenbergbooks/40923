<h2><a name="ARTHUR_JAMES_BALFOUR" id="ARTHUR_JAMES_BALFOUR">ARTHUR JAMES BALFOUR</a></h2>

<p class="p2">My first acquaintance with Mr. Arthur J.
Balfour, who recently became Prime Minister
of King Edward VII., was made in the earliest
days of my experience as a member of the
House of Commons. The Fourth party, as it
was called, had just been formed under the inspiration
of the late Lord Randolph Churchill.
The Fourth party was a new political enterprise.
The House of Commons up to that
time contained three regular and recognized
political parties&mdash;the supporters of the Government,
the supporters of the Opposition, and
the members of the Irish Nationalist party, of
whom I was one. Lord Randolph Churchill
created a Fourth party, the business of which
was to act independently alike of the Government,
the Opposition, and the Irish Nationalists.
At the time when I entered Parliament
the Conservatives were in power, and Conservative
statesmen occupied the Treasury Bench.
The members of Lord Randolph's party were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
all Conservatives so far as general political
principles were concerned, but Lord Randolph's
idea was to lead a number of followers who
should be prepared and ready to speak and vote
against any Government proposal which they
believed to be too conservative or not conservative
enough; to support the Liberal Opposition
in the rare cases when they thought the
Opposition was in the right; and to support
the Irish Nationalists when they believed that
these were unfairly dealt with, or when they believed,
which happened much more frequently,
that to support the Irishmen would be an annoyance
to the party in power.</p>

<p>The Fourth party was made up of numbers
exactly corresponding with the title which had
been given to it. Four men, including the
leader, constituted the whole strength of this
little army. These men were Lord Randolph
Churchill, Arthur J. Balfour, John Gorst (now
Sir John Gorst), and Sir Henry Drummond
Wolff, who has during more recent years withdrawn
altogether from parliamentary life and
given himself up to diplomacy, in which he has
won much honorable distinction. Sir John
Gorst has recently held office in the Government,
and is believed to have given and felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
little satisfaction in his official career. He is a
man of great ability and acquirements, but these
have been somewhat thrown away in the business
of administration.</p>

<p>The Fourth Party certainly did much to
make the House of Commons a lively place. Its
members were always in attendance&mdash;the
whole four of them&mdash;and no one ever knew
where, metaphorically, to place them. They
professed and made manifest open scorn for the
conventionalities of party life, and the parliamentary
whips never knew when they could be
regarded as supporters or opponents. They
were all effective debaters, all ready with sarcasm
and invective, all sworn foes to dullness
and routine, all delighting in any opportunity
for obstructing and bewildering the party which
happened to be in power. The members of
the Fourth party had each of them a distinct
individuality, although they invariably acted together
and were never separated in the division
lobbies. A member of the House of Commons
likened them once in a speech to D'Artagnan
and his Three Musketeers, as pictured in the
immortal pages of the elder Dumas. John
Gorst he described as Porthos, Sir Henry
Drummond Wolff as Athos, and Arthur Bal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>four
as the sleek and subtle Aramis. When I
entered Parliament I was brought much into
companionship with the members of this interesting
Fourth party. One reason for this habit
of intercourse was that we sat very near to one
another on the benches of the House. The
members of the Irish Nationalist party then, as
now, always sat on the side of the Opposition,
no matter what Government happened to be in
power, for the principle of the Irish Nationalists
is to regard themselves as in perpetual opposition
to every Government so long as Ireland is
deprived of her own national legislature. Soon
after I entered the House a Liberal Government
was the result of a general election, and
the Fourth party, as habitually conservative,
sat on the Opposition benches. The Fourth
party gave frequent support to the Irish Nationalists
in their endeavors to resist and obstruct
Government measures, and we therefore
came into habitual intercourse, and even comradeship,
with Lord Randolph Churchill and
his small band of followers.</p>

<p>Arthur Balfour bore little resemblance, in
appearance, in manners, in debating qualities,
and apparently in mould of intellect, to any of
the three men with whom he was then con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>stantly
allied. He was tall, slender, pale, graceful,
with something of an almost feminine
attractiveness in his bearing, although he was
as ready, resolute, and stubborn a fighter as
any one of his companions in arms. He had
the appearance and the ways of a thoughtful
student and scholar, and one would have associated
him rather with a college library or a
professor's chair than with the rough and boisterous
ways of the House of Commons. He
seemed to have come from another world of
thought and feeling into that eager, vehement,
and sometimes rather uproarious political assembly.
Unlike his uncle, Lord Salisbury, he
was known to enjoy social life, but he was
especially given to that select order of æsthetic
social life which was "sicklied o'er with the
pale cast of thought," a form of life which was
rather fashionable in society just then. But it
must have been clear even to the most superficial
observer that he had a decided gift of
parliamentary capacity. He was a fluent and a
ready speaker and could bear an effective part
in any debate at a moment's notice, but he
never declaimed, never indulged in any flight
of eloquence, and seldom raised his clear and
musical voice much above the conversational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pitch. His choice of language was always
happy and telling, and he often expressed himself
in characteristic phrases which lived in the
memory and passed into familiar quotation.
He had won some distinction as a writer by his
"Defense of Philosophic Doubt," by a volume
of "Essays and Addresses," and more lately by
his work entitled "The Foundations of Belief."
The first and last of these books were inspired
by a graceful and easy skepticism which had
in it nothing particularly destructive to the
faith of any believer, but aimed only at the not
difficult task of proving that a doubting ingenuity
can raise curious cavils from the practical
and argumentative point of view against one
creed as well as against another. The world
did not take these skeptical ventures very seriously,
and they were for the most part regarded
as the attempts of a clever young man to show
how much more clever he was than the ordinary
run of believing mortals. Balfour's style
was clear and vigorous, and people read the
essays because of the writer's growing position
in political life, and out of curiosity to see how
the rising young statesman could display himself
as the avowed advocate of philosophic
skepticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Arthur Balfour took a conspicuous part in
the attack made upon the Liberal Government
in 1882 on the subject of the once famous Kilmainham
Treaty. The action which he took in
this instance was avowedly inspired by a desire
to embarrass and oppose the Government because
of the compromise into which it had endeavored
to enter with Charles Stewart Parnell
for some terms of agreement as to the manner
in which legislation in Ireland ought to be administered.
The full history of what was called
the Kilmainham Treaty has not, so far as I
know, been ever correctly given to the public,
and it is not necessary, when surveying the political
career of Mr. Balfour, to enter into any
lengthened explanation on the subject. Mr.
Parnell was in prison at the time when the arrangement
was begun, and those who were in
his confidence were well aware that he was becoming
greatly alarmed as to the state of Ireland
under the rule of the late W. E. Forster,
who was then Chief Secretary to the Lord
Lieutenant, and under whose operations leading
Irishmen were thrown into prison on no
definite charge, but because their general conduct
left them open in the mind of the Chief
Secretary to the suspicion that their public agi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>tation
was likely to bring about a rebellious
movement. Parnell began to fear that the state
of the country would become worse and worse
if every popular movement were to be forcibly
repressed at the time when the leaders in whom
the Irish people had full confidence were kept
in prison and their guidance, control, and authority
withdrawn from the work of pacification.
The proposed arrangement, whether begun by
Mr. Parnell himself or suggested to him by
members of his own party or of the English
Radical party, was simply an understanding
that if the leading Irishmen were allowed to
return to their public work the country might
at least be kept in peace while English Liberalism
was devising some measures for the better
government of Ireland. The arrangement was
in every sense creditable alike to Parnell and
to the English Liberals who were anxious to cooperate
with him in such a purpose. But it
led to some disturbance in Mr. Gladstone's
government and to Mr. Forster's resignation
of his office. In 1885, when the Conservatives
again came into power and formed a government,
Balfour was appointed President of the
Local Government Board and afterwards became
Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&mdash;in
other words, Chief Secretary for Ireland.
He had to attempt a difficult, or rather, it should
be said, an impossible task, and he got through
it about as well as, or as badly as, any other
man could have done whose appointed mission
was to govern Ireland on Tory principles for
the interests of the landlords and by the policy
of coercion.</p>

<p>Balfour, it should be said, was never, even
at that time, actually unpopular with the Irish
National party. We all understood quite well
that his own heart did not go with the sort of
administrative work which was put upon him;
his manners were always courteous, agreeable,
and graceful; he had a keen, quiet sense
of humor, was on good terms personally with
the leading Irish members, and never showed
any inclination to make himself needlessly or
wantonly offensive to his opponents. He was
always readily accessible to any political opponent
who had any suggestion to make, and his
term of office as Chief Secretary, although of
necessity quite unsuccessful for any practical
good, left no memories of rancor behind it in
the minds of those whom he had to oppose and
to confront. More lately he became First Lord
of the Treasury and Leader of the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Commons, and the remainder of his public
career is too well known to call for any detailed
description here. My object in this article is
rather to give a living picture of the man himself
as we all saw him in public life than to
record in historical detail the successive steps
by which he ascended to his present high position,
or rather, it should be said, of the successive
events which brought that place within his
reach and made it necessary for him to accept
it. For it is only fair to say that, so far as
outer observers could judge, Mr. Balfour never
made his career a struggle for high positions.
So clever and gifted a man must naturally have
had some ambition in the public field to which
he had devoted so absolutely his time and his
talents. But he seemed, so far as one could
judge, to have in him none of the self-seeking
qualities which are commonly seen in the man
whose purpose is to make his parliamentary
work the means of arriving at the highest post
in the government of the State. On the contrary,
his whole demeanor seemed to be rather
that of one who is devoting himself unwillingly
to a career not quite congenial. He always
appeared to me to be essentially a man of literary,
scholarly, and even retiring tastes, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
has a task forced upon him which he does not
feel quite free to decline, and who therefore
strives to make the best of a career which he
has not chosen, but from which he does not
feel at liberty to turn away. Most men who
have attained the same political position give
one the idea that they feel a positive delight
in parliamentary life and warfare, and that nature
must have designed them for that particular
field and for none other. The joy in the strife
which men like Palmerston, like Disraeli, and
like Gladstone evidently felt never showed itself
in the demeanor of Arthur Balfour. There was
always something in his manner which spoke
of a shy and shrinking disposition, and he never
appeared to enter into debate for the mere
pleasure of debating. He gave the idea of one
who would much rather not make a speech
were he altogether free to please himself in the
matter, and as if he were only constraining
himself to undertake a duty which most of
those around him were but too glad to have an
opportunity of attempting.</p>

<p>There are instances, no doubt, of men gifted
with an absolute genius for eloquent speech
who have had no natural inclination for debate
and would rather have been free from any ne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>cessity
for entering into the war of words. I
have heard John Bright say that he would
never make a speech if he did not feel it a duty
imposed upon him, and that he would never
enter the House of Commons if he felt free to
keep away from its debates. Yet Bright was a
born orator and was, on the whole, I think, the
greatest public and parliamentary orator I have
ever heard in England, not excluding even
Gladstone himself. Bright had all the physical
qualities of the orator. He had a commanding
presence and a voice of the most marvelous
intonation, capable of expressing in musical
sound every emotion which lends itself to eloquence&mdash;the
impassioned, the indignant, the
pathetic, the appealing, and the humorous.
Then I can recall an instance of another man,
not, indeed, endowed with Bright's superb oratorical
gifts, but who had to spend the greater
part of his life since he attained the age of
manhood in the making of speeches within and
outside the House of Commons. I am thinking
now of Charles Stewart Parnell. I know
well that Parnell would never have made a
speech if he could have avoided the task, and
that he even felt a nervous dislike to the mere
putting of a question in the House. But no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
one would have known from Bright's manner
when he took part in a great debate that he
was not obeying in congenial mood the full
instinct and inclination of a born orator. Nor
would a stranger have guessed from Parnell's
clear, self-possessed, and precise style of speaking
that he was putting a severe constraint
upon himself when he made up his mind to
engage in parliamentary debate. There is something
in Arthur Balfour's manner as a speaker
which occasionally reminds me of Parnell and
his style. The two men had the same quiet,
easy, and unconcerned fashion of utterance,
always choosing the most appropriate word and
finding it without apparent difficulty; each man
seemed, as I have already said of Balfour, to be
thinking aloud rather than trying to convince
the listeners; each man spoke as if resolved
not to waste any words or to indulge in any
appeal to the mere emotions of the audience.
But the natural reluctance to take any part in
debate was always more conspicuous in the
manner of Balfour than even in that of Parnell.</p>

<p>Balfour is a man of many and varied tastes
and pursuits. He is an advocate of athleticism
and is especially distinguished for his devotion
to the game of golf. He obtained at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
time a certain reputation in London society
because of the interest he took in some peculiar
phases of fanciful intellectual inventiveness.
He was for a while a leading member, if not
the actual inventor, of a certain order of psychical
research whose members were described
as The Souls. More than one novelist of the
day made picturesque use of this singular order
and enlivened the pages of fiction by fancy portraits
of its leading members. Such facts as
these did much to prevent Balfour from being
associated in the public mind with only the rivalries
of political parties and the incidents of parliamentary
warfare. One sometimes came into
social circles where Balfour was regarded chiefly
as the man of literary tastes and somewhat
eccentric intellectual developments. All this
cast a peculiar reflection over his career as a
politician and filled many observers with the
idea that he was only playing at parliamentary
life, and that his other occupations were the
genuine realities for him. Even to this day
there are some who persist in believing that
Balfour, despite his prolonged and unvarying
attention to his parliamentary duties, has never
given his heart to the prosaic and practical
work of administrative office and the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of maintaining his political party. Yet it has
always had to be acknowledged that no man
attended more carefully and more closely to
such work when he had to do it, and that the
most devoted worshiper of political success
could not have been more regular and constant
in his attention to the business of the House
of Commons. People said that he was lazy by
nature, that he loved long hours of sleep and
of general rest, and that he detested the methodical
and mechanical routine of official work.
But I have not known any Minister of State
who was more easy of approach and more ready
to enter into the driest details of departmental
business than Arthur Balfour. I may say, too,
that, whenever appeal was made to him to forward
any good work or to do any act of kindness,
he was always to be found at his post and
was ever ready to lend a helping hand if he
could.</p>

<p>I remember one instance of this kind which
I have no hesitation in mentioning, although
I am quite sure Mr. Balfour had little inclination
for its obtaining publicity. Not very
many years ago it was brought to my knowledge
that an English literary woman who had
won much and deserved distinction as a novel-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>writer
had been for some time sinking into ill
health, had been therefore prevented from going
on with her work, and had in the mean time
been perplexed by worldly difficulties and embarrassments
which interfered sadly with her
prospects and made her a subject of well-merited
sympathy. Some friends of the authoress were
naturally anxious, if possible, to give her a helping
hand, and the idea occurred to them that
she would be a most fitting recipient of assistance
to be bestowed by a department of the
State. One of her friends, himself a distinguished
novelist, who happened to be also a
friend of mine, spoke to me with this object,
assuming that, as an old parliamentary hand,
I knew more than most writers of books would
be likely to know about the manner in which
such help might be obtained. There is in England
a fund&mdash;a very small fund, truly&mdash;at the
disposal of the Government for the help of deserving
authors who happen to be in distress.
This fund is at the disposal of the First Lord
of the Treasury, the office which was then, as
now, held by Arthur Balfour. I was still at
that time a member of the House of Commons,
and my friend suggested that, as I knew something
about the whole business, I might be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
suitable person to represent the case to the
First Lord of the Treasury and make appeal
for his assistance. My friend's belief was that
the application might come with more effect
from one who had been for a long time a member
of Parliament, and whose name would therefore
be known to the First Lord of the Treasury,
than from a literary man who had nothing
to do with parliamentary life. Nothing could
give me greater pleasure than to become the
medium through which the appeal might be
brought under the notice of the First Lord, but
I felt some difficulty and doubt because of the
conditions of the time. England was then in
the most distracting period of the South African
war. We were hearing every day of fresh mishaps
and disasters in the campaign. Arthur
Balfour was Leader of the House of Commons,
and had to deal every day with questions,
with demands for explanation, with arguments
and debates turning on the events of the war.
It seemed to me to be rather a venturesome
enterprise to attempt to gain the attention of a
minister thus perplexingly occupied for a matter
of merely private and individual concern. I
feared that an overworked statesman might
feel naturally inclined to remit the subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the care of some mere official, and that time
might thus be lost and the needed helping hand
be long delayed. I undertook the task, however,
and I wrote to Mr. Balfour at once. I
received the very next day a reply written in
Mr. Balfour's own hand, expressing his cordial
willingness to consider the subject, his sympathy
with the purpose of the appeal, and his
hope that some help might be given to the distressed
novelist. Mr. Balfour promptly took
the matter in hand, and the result was that a
grant was made from the State fund to secure
the novelist against any actual distress. Now,
I do not want to make too much of this act of
ready kindness done by Mr. Balfour. The
appeal was made for a most deserving object;
the fund from which help was to be given was
entirely at Mr. Balfour's disposal; and it is
probable that any other First Lord in the same
circumstances would have come to the same
decision. But how easy it would have been
for Mr. Balfour to put the whole matter into
the hands of some subordinate, and not to add
a new trouble to his own intensely busy life at
such an exciting crisis by entering into the
close consideration of a mere question of State
beneficence! I certainly should not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
surprised if I had not received an answer to
my letter for several days after I had sent it,
and if even then it had come from some subordinate
in the Government department. But
in the midst of all his incessant and distracting
occupations at a most exciting period of public
business Mr. Balfour found time to consider
the question himself, to reply with his own
hand, and to see that the desired help was
promptly accorded. I must say that I think
this short passage of personal history speaks
highly for the kindly nature and the sympathetic
promptitude of Arthur Balfour.</p>

<p>For a long time there had been much speculation
in these countries concerning the probable
successor to Lord Salisbury, whenever
Lord Salisbury should make up his mind to
resign the position of Prime Minister. We all
knew that that resignation was sure to come
soon, although very few of us had any idea that
it was likely to come quite so soon. The
general opinion was that the country would not
be expected, for some time at least, to put up
again with a Prime Minister in the House of
Lords. If, therefore, the new Prime Minister
had to be found in the House of Commons,
there seemed to be only a choice between two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
men, Arthur Balfour and Joseph Chamberlain.
It would be hard to find two men in the House
of Commons more unlike each other in characteristic
qualities and in training than these
two. They are both endowed with remarkable
capacity for political life and for parliamentary
debate, "but there," as Byron says concerning
two of whom one was a Joseph, "I doubt all
likeness ends between the pair." Balfour is an
aristocrat of aristocrats; Chamberlain is essentially
a man of the British middle class&mdash;even
what is generally called the lower middle class.
Balfour has gone through all the regular course
of university education; Chamberlain was for a
short time at University College School in London,
a popular institution of modern origin
which does most valuable educational work, but
is not largely patronized by the classes who
claim aristocratic position. Balfour is a constant
reader and student of many literatures
and languages; "Mr. Chamberlain," according
to a leading article in a London daily newspaper,
"to put it mildly, is not a bookworm." Balfour
loves open-air sports and is a votary of athleticism;
Chamberlain never takes any exercise, even
walking exercise, when he can possibly avoid
the trouble. Balfour is an æsthetic lover of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the arts; Chamberlain has never, so far as I
know, given the slightest indication of interest
in any artistic subject. Balfour is by nature a
modest and retiring man; Chamberlain is always
"Pushful Joe." The stamp and character
of a successful municipal politician are always
evident in Chamberlain, while Balfour seems to
be above all other things the university scholar
and member of high society. I suppose it
must have been a profound disappointment to
Chamberlain that he was not offered the place
of Prime Minister, but it would be hardly fair
to expect that such a place would not be offered
to the First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of
the House of Commons, even if that First Lord
did not happen to be a nephew of the retiring
Prime Minister.</p>

<p>It would be idle just now to enter into any
speculation as to whether Mr. Arthur Balfour
will long continue to hold the office. If he
should make up his mind, as was at one time
thought possible by many observers, to accept
a peerage and become Prime Minister in the
House of Lords, such a step would undoubtedly
be a means of pacifying the partisans of Chamberlain,
for Chamberlain would then become,
almost as a matter of course, the leader of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Conservative government in the House of Commons,
and this elevation might well satisfy his
ambition and give his pushful energy work
enough to do. But the country has of late become
less and less satisfied with the practice
of having a Prime Minister removed from the
centre of active life and hidden away in the
enervating atmosphere of the House of Lords.
The friends of Mr. Balfour are naturally inclined
to hope and believe that he will not bury
himself in such a living tomb. His path will
in any case be perplexed by many difficulties
and obstructions. My own impression is that
the inevitable reaction is destined to come before
long. The next general election may
prove that the country at large is tired of a
Conservative administration. The public mind
will soon get over the feverish excitement created
by the South African war, and people will
begin to remember that England had won
battles and annexed territory before there ever
was a Transvaal Republic, and found then, as
she will find now, that successes abroad do not
relieve her from the necessity of managing
successfully her business at home. It has to be
borne in mind, too, that the House of Commons
does not really originate anything in the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of important legislation. The best business of
the Liberal party begins outside the House of
Commons&mdash;begins with the people and with
those who take an interest in the welfare of the
people and have brains and foresight enough to
find out how it can be most thoroughly promoted.
All great reforms have their origin
outside the House of Commons and are only
taken up by the House of Commons when it is
felt that the popular demand is so earnest that
it must receive serious consideration. The
country will soon begin to realize the fact that,
shamefully mismanaged as the War Department
may have been during the recent campaigns,
the War Department is not by any
means the only national institution which needs
the strong hand of reform. The spirited foreign
policy has had its innings, and the condition of
the people at home must have its turn very
soon. The Liberal party has its work cut out
for it, and where there is the work to be done a
Liberal party will be found to do it. So far as
I can read the signs of the times, I am encouraged
to hope that a great opportunity is waiting
for the Liberal party, and I cannot see the
slightest reason to doubt that a Liberal party
will be found ready for the opportunity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
equal to it. A Tory Prime Minister has, indeed,
before now had the judgment and the
energy to forestall the Liberal party in the
great work of domestic reform, but I do not
believe that even the warmest admirers of Mr.
Balfour imagine that he is quite the man to
undertake such an enterprise. Arthur Balfour
is, according to my judgment, the best man for
the place to be found in the Conservative ranks
at present, but I do not suppose that he is
destined just now to be anything more than a
stop-gap. I admire his great and varied abilities,
I recognize his brilliant debating powers,
and I have felt the charm of his genial and
graceful manners, but I do not believe him
capable of maintaining the present administration
against the rising force of a Liberal
reaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2>LORD SALISBURY</h2>

<p class="p2">The retirement of Lord Salisbury from the
position of Prime Minister and the leadership
of the Conservative Government withdraws into
comparative obscurity the most interesting and
even picturesque figure in the English Parliamentary
life of the present day. Even the most
uncompromising opponents of the Prime Minister
and of his political party felt a sincere
respect for the character, the intellect, and the
bearing of the man himself. Every one gave
Lord Salisbury full credit for absolute sincerity
of purpose, for superiority to any personal ambitions
or mere self-seeking, for an almost
contemptuous disregard of State honors and
political fame.</p>

<p>Yet it was not that Lord Salisbury was habitually
careful and measured in his speech, that
he was never hurried into rash utterances, that
he was guided by any particular anxiety to avoid
offending the susceptibilities of others, or, indeed,
that, as a rule, he preferred to use sooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>ing
words in political controversy. He has, on
the contrary, a marvelous gift of sarcasm and
of satirical phrase-making, and he was only too
ready to indulge occasionally this peculiar capacity
at the expense of political friend as well
as of political foe. In his early days of public
life, when he sat in the House of Commons as
a nominal follower of Mr. Disraeli, he was once
described in debate by his nominal leader as
"a master of flouts and jeers." On another occasion
Disraeli spoke of him, although not in
Parliamentary debate, as a young man whose
head was on fire. In later days, and even when
he had held high administrative office, Lord
Salisbury often indulged in sudden outbursts of
contemptuous humor which for a time seemed
likely to provoke indignant remonstrance even
from his own followers. One illustration of this
unlucky tendency towards contemptuous utterance
may be found in his famous allusion several
years ago to a native of Hindustan, who
had been elected to a seat in the House of
Commons, as "a black man." That was a time
when every English public man recognized the
great importance of indulging in no expression
which might seem calculated to wound the susceptibilities
of the many races who have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
brought under the rule of the Imperial system
in the Indian dominions of the sovereign. The
member of Parliament thus scornfully alluded
to was no more a black man than Lord Salisbury
himself. He was one of the Parsee races
chiefly found in the Bombay regions, almost
European in the color of their skin, and he
looked more like a German scholar than a native
of any sunburnt land. No one defended
Lord Salisbury's rash utterance, but many people
excused it on the ground that it was only
Lord Salisbury's way; that he never meant any
harm, but could not resist the temptation of
saying an amusing and sarcastic thing when it
came into his mind. The truth is that Lord
Salisbury's odd humor is a peculiarity without
which he could not be the complete Lord Salisbury,
and an unlucky expression was easily forgiven
because of the many brilliant flashes of
genuine and not unfair sarcasm with which
he was accustomed to illumine a dull debate.
When he succeeded to his father's title, and
had, therefore, to leave the House of Commons
and take his place in the House of Lords, every
one felt that the representative chamber had
lost one of its most attractive figures, and that
the hereditary chamber was not exactly the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in which such a man could find his happiest
hunting-ground. Yet even in the somber and
unimpressive House of Lords, Lord Salisbury
was able, whenever the humor took him, to
brighten the debates by his apt illustrations
and his witty humor.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury resigns his position as Prime
Minister at a time of life when, according to
the present standards of age, a man is still supposed
to have long years of good work before
him. Lord Palmerston's career as Prime Minister
was cut short only by his death, an event
which occurred when Palmerston was in his
eighty-first year. Gladstone was more than ten
years older than Lord Salisbury is now when
he voluntarily gave up his position as head of
a Liberal administration. Lord Beaconsfield's
time of birth is somewhat uncertain, but he
must have been some seventy-seven years of
age and had lost none of his powers as a debater
when his brilliant life came to its close.
We may take it for granted that Lord Salisbury
had been for a long time growing tired of
the exalted political position which had of late
become uncongenial with his habits and his
frame of mind. By the death of his wife he
had lost the most loved companion of his home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
his intellectual tastes, and his political career.
A pair more thoroughly devoted to each other
than Lord and Lady Salisbury could hardly
have been found even in the pages of romance.
The whole story of that marriage and that married
life would have supplied a touching and a
telling chapter for romance. Early in his public
career Lord Salisbury fell in love with a
charming, gifted, and devoted woman, whom a
happy chance had brought in his way. She
was the daughter of an eminent English judge,
the late Baron Alderson; and although such a
wife might have been thought a suitable match
even for a great aristocrat, it appears that the
Lord Salisbury of that time, the father of the
late Prime Minister, who was then only Lord
Robert Cecil, did not approve of the marriage,
and the young pair had to take their own way
and become husband and wife without regard
for the family prejudices. Lord Robert Cecil
was then only a younger brother with a younger
brother's allowance to live on, and the newly
wedded pair had not much of a prospect before
them, in the conventional sense of the
words. Lord Robert Cecil accepted the situation
with characteristic courage and resolve.
There seemed at that time no likelihood of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
ever succeeding to the title and the estates,
for his elder brother was living, and was, of
course, heir to the ancestral title and property.
Lord Robert Cecil had been gifted with distinct
literary capacity, and he set himself down
to work as a writer and a journalist. He became
a regular contributor to the "Saturday
Review," then at the height of its influence
and fame, and he wrote articles for some of
the ponderous quarterly reviews of the time,
brightening their pages by his animated and
forcible style. He took a small house in a
modest quarter of London, where artists and
poets and authors of all kinds usually made a
home then, far removed from West End fashion
and courtly splendor, and there he lived a
happy and productive life for many years. He
had obtained a seat in the House of Commons
as a member of the Conservative party, but he
never pledged himself to support every policy
and every measure undertaken by the Conservative
leaders, whether they happened to be in
or out of office. Lord Robert always acted as
an independent member, although he adhered
conscientiously to the cardinal principles of that
Conservative doctrine which was his political
faith throughout his life. He soon won for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
himself a marked distinction in the House of
Commons. He was always a brilliant speaker,
but was thoughtful and statesmanlike as well
as brilliant. He never became an orator in the
higher sense of the word. He never attempted
any flights of exalted eloquence. His speeches
were like the utterances of a man who is thinking
aloud and whose principal object is to hold
and convince his listeners by the sheer force of
argument set forth in clear and telling language.
Many of his happy phrases found acceptance
as part of the ordinary language of political and
social life and became in their way immortal.
Up to the present day men are continually
quoting happy phrases drawn from Lord Robert
Cecil's early speeches without remembering
the source from which they came.</p>

<p>Such a capacity as that of Lord Robert Cecil
could not long be overlooked by the leaders of
his party, and it soon became quite clear that
he must be invited to administrative office. I
ought to say that, after Lord Robert had completed
his collegiate studies at Oxford, he devoted
himself for a considerable time to an
extensive course of travel, and he visited Australasia,
then but little known to young Englishmen
of his rank, and he actually did much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
practical work as a digger in the Australian
gold mines, then newly discovered. He had
always a deep interest in foreign affairs, and
it was greatly to the advantage of his subsequent
career that he could often support his
arguments on questions of foreign policy by
experience drawn from a personal study of the
countries and States forming successive subjects
of debate. Suddenly his worldly prospects
underwent a complete change. The death of
his elder brother made him heir to the family
title and the great estates. He became Viscount
Cranborne in succession to his dead brother.
I may perhaps explain, for the benefit of some
of my American readers, that the heir to a
peerage who bears what is called a courtesy
title has still a right to sit, if elected, in the
House of Commons. It is sometimes a source
of wonder and puzzlement to foreign visitors
when they find so many men sitting in the
House of Commons who actually bear titles
which would make it seem as if they ought to
be in the House of Lords. The eldest sons of
all the higher order of peers bear such a title,
but it carries with it no disqualification for a
seat in the House of Commons, if the bearer
of it be duly elected to a place in the repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>sentative
chamber. When the bearer of the
courtesy title succeeds to the actual title belonging
to the house, he then, as a matter of
course, becomes a peer, has to enter the House
of Lords, and would no longer be legally eligible
to sit in the representative chamber. Lord
Palmerston's presence in the House of Commons
was often a matter of wonder to foreign
visitors, for in all the days to which my memory
goes back, Lord Palmerston seemed too
old a man to have a father alive and in the
House of Lords. I have had to explain the
matter to many a stranger, and it only gives
one other illustration of the peculiarities and
anomalies which belong to our Parliamentary
system. Palmerston's was not a courtesy title;
the noble lord was a peer in his own right;
but then he was merely an Irish peer, and only
a certain number of Irish peers are entitled to
sit in the House of Lords. The more fortunate,
for so I must describe them, of the Irish
peers not thus entitled to sit in the hereditary
chamber are free to seek election for an English
constituency in the House of Commons
and to obtain it, as Lord Palmerston did. Lord
Viscount Cranborne, therefore, continued for a
time to hold the place in the House of Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>mons
which he had held as Lord Robert Cecil.
In 1866 Lord Cranborne entered office, for the
first time, as Secretary of State for India during
the administration of Lord Derby.</p>

<p>The year following brought about a sort of
crisis in Lord Cranborne's political career, and
probably showed the general public of England,
for the first time, what manner of man he
really was. Up to that period he had been
regarded by most persons, even among those
who habitually gave attention to Parliamentary
affairs, as a brilliant, independent, and somewhat
audacious free-lance whose political conduct
was usually directed by the impulse of the
moment, and who made no pretensions to any
fixed and ruling principles. That was the year
1867, when the Conservative Government under
Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli took it into their
heads to try the novel experiment, for a Conservative
party, of introducing a Reform Bill
to improve and expand the conditions of the
Parliamentary suffrage. Disraeli was the author
of this new scheme, and it had been suggested
to him by Mr. Gladstone's failure in the previous
year with his measure of reform. Gladstone's
reform measure did not go far enough
to satisfy the genuine Radicals, while it went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
much too far for a considerable number of
doubtful and half-hearted Liberals, and it was
strongly opposed by the whole Tory party. As
usually happens in the case of every reform
introduced by a Liberal administration, a secession
took place among the habitual followers of
the Government. The secession in this case
was made famous by the name which Bright
conferred upon it as the "Cave of Adullam"
party; and by the co-operation of the seceding
section with the Tory Opposition, the measure
was defeated, and Mr. Gladstone went out of
office. Disraeli saw, with his usual sagacity,
that the vast mass of the population were in
favor of some measure of reform, and when
Lord Derby and he came into office he made
up his mind that, as the thing had to be done,
he and his colleagues might as well have the
advantage of doing it. The outlines of the
measure prepared for the purpose only shaped
a very vague and moderate scheme of reform,
but Disraeli was quite determined to accept
any manner of compromises in order to carry
some sort of scheme and to keep himself and
his party in power. But then arose a new difficulty
on which, with all his sagacity, he had
not calculated. Lord Cranborne for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
time showed that he was a man of clear and
resolute political principle, and that he was not
willing to sacrifice any of his conscientious convictions
for the sake of maintaining his place
in a Government. He was sincerely opposed
to every project for making the suffrage popular
and for admitting the mass of the workingmen
of the country to any share in its government.
I need hardly say that I am entirely
opposed to Lord Cranborne's political theories,
but I am none the less willing to render full
justice to the sincerity, not too common among
rising public men, which refused to make any
compromise on a matter of political principle.
Lord Cranborne was then only at the opening
of his administrative career, and he must have
had personal ambition enough to make him
wish for a continuance of office in a powerful
administration. But he put all personal considerations
resolutely aside, and resigned his
place in the Government rather than have anything
to do with a project which he believed to
be a surrender of constitutional principle to the
demands of the growing democracy. Lord Carnarvon
and one or two other members of the
administration followed his lead and resigned
their places in the Government. I need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
enter into much detail as to the progress of the
Disraeli reform measure. It is enough to say
that Disraeli obtained the support of many
Radicals by the Liberal amendments which he
accepted, and the result was that a Tory Government
carried to success a scheme of reform
which practically amounted to the introduction
of household suffrage. Lord Cranborne and
those who acted with him held firmly to their
principles, and steadily opposed the measure
introduced by those who at the opening of the
session were their official leaders and colleagues.
I am convinced that even the most advanced
reformers were ready to give a due meed of
praise to the man who had thus made it evident
that he preferred what he believed to be a
political principle, even though he knew it to
be the principle of a losing cause, to any consideration
of personal advancement.</p>

<p>Some of us felt sure that we had then learned
for the first time what manner of man Lord
Cranborne really was. We had taken him for
a bold and brilliant adventurer, and we found
and were ready to acknowledge that he was a
man of deep, sincere, and self-sacrificing convictions.
I have never from that time changed my
opinions with regard to Lord Cranborne's per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>sonal
character. His career interested me from
the first moment that I had an opportunity of
observing it, and I may say that from an early
period of my manhood I had much opportunity
of studying the ways and the figures of Parliamentary
life. But until Lord Cranborne had
taken this resolute position on the reform question,
I had never given him credit for any depth of
political convictions. The impression I formed
of him up to that time was that he was merely
a younger son of a great aristocratic family, who
had a natural aptitude alike for literature and for
politics, and that he was following in Parliament
the guidance of his own personal humors and
argumentative impulses, and that he was ready
to sacrifice in debate not only his friends but
his party for the sake of saying a clever thing
and startling his audience into reluctant admiration.
From those days of 1867 I knew him
to be what all the world now knows him to be,
a man of deep and sincere convictions, ever following
the light of what he believes to be political
wisdom and justice. I can say this none
the less readily because I suppose it has hardly
ever been my fortune to agree with any of Lord
Salisbury's utterances on questions of political
importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1868 the career of Lord Cranborne in the
House of Commons came to an end by the
death of his father. He succeeded to the title
of Marquis of Salisbury, and became, as a matter
of course, a member of the House of Lords.
He was thus withdrawn while still a comparatively
young man from that stirring field of
splendid debate where his highest qualities as
a speaker could alone have found their fitting
opportunity. I need not trace out his subsequent
public career with any sequence of detail.
We all know how from that time to this he has
held high office, has come to hold the highest
offices in the State whenever his political party
happened to be in power. He has been Foreign
Secretary; he has been Prime Minister in
three Conservative administrations. For a time
he actually combined the functions of Prime
Minister and those of Foreign Secretary. He
was envoy to the great conference at Constantinople
in 1876 and 1877, and he took part in
the Congress of Berlin, that conference which
Lord Beaconsfield declared brought to England
peace with honor. Everything that a man
could have to gratify his ambition Lord Salisbury
has had since the day when he succeeded
to his father's title and estates. His own intel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>lectual
force and his political capacity must
undoubtedly have made a way for him to Parliamentary
influence and success even if he had
always remained Lord Robert Cecil, and his
elder brother had lived to succeed to the title.
But from the moment when Lord Robert Cecil
became the heir, it was certain that his party
could not venture to overlook him. He might
have made eccentric speeches, he might have
indulged in sarcastic and scornful allusions to
his political leaders, he might have allowed obtrusive
scruples of conscience to interfere with
the interests of his party, but none the less it
became absolutely necessary that the Conservative
politicians should accept, when opportunity
came, the leadership of the Marquis of Salisbury.
"Thou hast it all"&mdash;the words which
Banquo applies to Macbeth&mdash;might have been
said of Lord Salisbury when he became for the
first time Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury certainly did not achieve his
position by any of the arts, even the less culpable
arts, which for a time secured to Macbeth
the highest reach of his ambition. Lord Salisbury's
leadership came to him and was not
sought by him. I cannot help thinking, however,
that, after he had once attained that su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>preme
position in his party, the remainder of
his public career has been something in the
nature of an anticlimax. Was it that the chill
and deadening influence of the House of Lords
proved too depressing for the energetic and
vivacious spirit which had won celebrity for
Lord Robert Cecil in the House of Commons?
Was it that Lord Salisbury, when he had attained
the height of his ambition, became a
victim to that mood of reaction which compels
such a man to ask himself whether, after all,
the work of ascent was not much better than
the attained elevation? Lord Salisbury's years
of high office coming now thus suddenly to an
end give to me at least the melancholy impression
of an unfulfilled career. The influence of
the Prime Minister, so far as mere outsiders
can judge of it, has always been exerted in foreign
affairs for the promotion of peace. Even
the late war in South Africa is not understood
to have been in any sense a war of his seeking.
The general belief is that the policy of war was
pressed upon him by influences which at the
time he was not able to control&mdash;influences
which would only have become all the stronger
if he had refused to accept the responsibility
of Prime Minister and had left it to others to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
carry on the work of government. However
this may be, it can hardly be questioned that
of late years Lord Salisbury had become that
which nobody in former days could ever suppose
him likely to become, the mere figurehead
of an administration. Lord Salisbury's whole
nature seems to have been too sincere, too free
from mere theatrical arts, to allow him to play
the part of leader where he had no heart in the
work of leadership. A statesman like Disraeli
might have disapproved of a certain policy and
done his best to reason his colleagues out of it,
but nevertheless, when he found himself likely
to be overborne, would have immersed himself
deliberately in all the new-born zeal of the convert
and would have behaved thenceforward as
if his whole soul were in the work which had
been put upon him to do. Lord Salisbury is
most assuredly not a man of this order, and he
never would or could put on an enthusiasm
which he did not feel in his heart. We can all
remember how, at the very zenith of British
passion against China during the recent political
convulsions and the intervention of the
foreign allies, Lord Salisbury astonished and
depressed some of his warmest admirers by a
speech which he made at Exeter Hall, a speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which, metaphorically at least, threw the coldest
of cold water on the popular British ardor for
forcing Western civilization on the Chinese
people.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury's frame of mind was one which
could never allow him to become even for a
moment a thorough Jingo, and through all the
later years of his power he held the office of
Prime Minister at a time when Jingoism was
the order of the day among the outside supporters
of the Conservative Government. He
never had a fair chance for the full development
of his intellectual faculties while he remained
at the head of a Conservative administration.
Under happier conditions he might
have been a great Prime Minister and a leading
force in political movement, but his intellect,
his tastes, and his habits of life did not allow
him to pay much deference to the prejudices
and passions of those on whom he was compelled
to rely for support. There was too much
in him of the thinker, the scholar, and the recluse
to make him a thoroughly effective leader of
the party who had to acknowledge his command.
He loved reading, he loved literature
and art, and he took no delight in the formal
social functions which are in our days an im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>portant
part of successful political administration.
He could not be "hail-fellow-well-met"
with every pushing follower who made it a
pride to be on terms of companionship with the
leader of the party. I have often heard that
he had a singularly bad memory for faces, and
that many a devoted Tory follower found his
enthusiasm chilled every now and then by the
obvious fact that the Prime Minister did not
seem to remember anything about the identity
of his obtrusive admirer. Much the same thing
has been said over and over again about Mr.
Gladstone, but then Gladstone had the inborn
genius of leadership, threw his soul into every
great political movement, and did not depend
in the slightest degree on his faculty for appreciating
and conciliating every individual follower.
Lord Salisbury's tastes were for the society
of his close personal friends, and I believe
no man could be a more genial host in the
company of those with whom he loved to associate;
but he had no interest in the ordinary
ways of society and made no effort to conciliate
those with whom he found himself in no manner
of companionship. He did not even take
any strong interest in the study of the most
remarkable figures in the political world around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
him, if he did not feel drawn into sympathy
with their ways and their opinions. On one
occasion, when a report had got about in the
newspapers that Lord Salisbury was often seen
in friendly companionship with the late Mr.
Parnell in the smoking-room of the House of
Commons, Lord Salisbury publicly stated that
he had never, to his knowledge, seen Parnell,
and had never been once in the House of Commons
smoking-room.</p>

<p>No man has been better known, so far as
personal appearance was concerned, to the general
English public than Lord Salisbury. He
has been as well known as Mr. Gladstone himself,
and one cannot say more than that. He
was a frequent walker in St. James's Park and
other places of common resort in the neighborhood
of the Houses of Parliament. Every one
knew the tall, broad, stooping figure with the
thick head of hair, the bent brows, and the
careless, shabby costume. No statesman of his
time was more indifferent than Lord Salisbury
to the dictates of fashion as regarded dress and
deportment. He was undoubtedly one of the
worst-dressed men of his order in London. In
this peculiarity he formed a remarkable contrast
to Lord Beaconsfield, who down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
very end of his life took care to be always
dressed according to the most recent dictates
of fashion. All this was strictly in keeping
with Lord Salisbury's character and temperament.
The world had to take him as he was&mdash;he
could never bring himself to act any part for
the sake of its effect upon the public. My own
impression is that when he was removed by the
decree of fate into the House of Lords and
taken away from the active, thrilling life of the
House of Commons, he felt himself excluded
from his congenial field of political action and
had but little interest in the game of politics
any more. He does not seem destined to a
place in the foremost rank of English Prime
Ministers, even of English Conservative Prime
Ministers. But his is beyond all question a
picturesque, a deeply interesting, and even a
commanding figure in English political history,
and the world will have reason to regret if his
voluntary retirement from the position of Prime
Minister should mean also his retirement from
the field of political life.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>LORD ROSEBERY</h2>

<p class="p2">Lord Rosebery was for a prolonged season
the man in English political life upon whom
the eyes of expectation were turned. He is a
younger man than most of his political colleagues
and rivals, but it is not because of his
comparative youth that the eyes of expectation
were and still are turned upon him. Not one
of those who stand in the front ranks of Parliamentary
life to-day could be called old, as
we reckon age in our modern estimate. Palmerston,
Gladstone, and Disraeli won their highest
political triumphs after they had passed
the age which Lord Salisbury and Sir William
Harcourt have now reached; Mr. Balfour
is still regarded in politics as quite a young
man, and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has
but lately been elected leader of the Liberal
party in the House of Commons. Lord Rosebery
has already held the highest political
offices. He has been Foreign Secretary and
he has been Prime Minister. He has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
leader of the Liberal party. No other public
man in England has so many and so varied
mental gifts, and no other public man has won
success in so many distinct fields. We live
in days when, for the time at least, the great
political orator seems to have passed out of
existence. The last great English orator died
at Hawarden a few short years ago. We have,
however, several brilliant and powerful Parliamentary
debaters, and among these Lord Rosebery
stands with the foremost, if he is not,
indeed, absolutely the foremost. As an orator
on what I may call great ceremonial occasions
he is, according to my judgment, the very foremost
we now have. As an after-dinner speaker&mdash;and
after-dinner speaking counts for a great
deal in the success of an English public man&mdash;he
has never had an equal in England during
my time. Then Lord Rosebery has delivered
lectures or addresses in commemoration of great
poets and philosophers and statesmen which
may even already be regarded as certain of an
abiding place in literature. Lord Rosebery is
a literary man, an author as well as a statesman
and an orator; he has written a life of
Pitt which is already becoming a sort of classic
in our libraries. There are profounder stu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>dents,
men more deeply read, than he, but I
doubt if there are many men living who have
so wide an acquaintance with general literature.
He is a lover as well as a student and a
connoisseur of art, he is an accomplished yachtsman,
has a thorough knowledge of horses, is
famous on the turf, and the owner of two
horses which won the Derby. The legendary
fairy godmother seems to have showered upon
him at his birth all her richest and most various
gifts, and no malign and jealous sprite appears
to have come in, as in the nursery stories, to
spoil any of the gifts by a counteracting spell.
He was born of great family and born to high
estate; he married a daughter of the house of
Rothschild; he has a lordly home near Edinburgh
in Scotland, a noble house in the finest
West End square of London, and a delightful
residence in one of our most beautiful English
counties.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery is one of the most charming
talkers whom it has ever been my good fortune
to meet. He has a keen sense of humor,
a happy art of light and delicate satire, and, in
private conversation as well as in Parliamentary
debate, he has a singular facility for the invention
of expressive and successful phrases which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
tell their whole story in a flash. One might
well be inclined to ask what the kindly fates
could have done for Lord Rosebery that they
have left undone. Nevertheless, the truth has
to be told, that up to this time Lord Rosebery
has not accomplished as much of greatness as
most of us confidently expected that he would
achieve.</p>

<p>I have been, perhaps, somewhat too hasty in
saying that no counteracting spell had in any
way marred the influence of the gifts which the
fairies had so lavishly bestowed on Lord Rosebery.
One stroke of ill fortune&mdash;ill fortune,
that is, for an English political leader&mdash;was
certainly directed against him. Nature must
have meant him to be a successful Prime Minister,
and yet fortune denied him a seat in
the House of Commons. He succeeded to his
grandfather's peerage at an early period of his
life, and he had to begin his political career as
a member of the House of Lords. He therefore
missed all that splendid training for political
warfare which is given in the House of
Commons. It would not, perhaps, be quite
easy for an American reader to understand
how little the House of Lords counts for in the
education of fighting statesmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>When Charles James Fox was told in his declining
years that the King, as a mark of royal
favor, intended to make him a peer and thus
remove him from the House of Commons into
the House of Lords, he struck his forehead and
exclaimed: "Good Heaven! he does not think
it has come to that with me, does he?" Fox
had had all the training that his genius needed
in the House of Commons, and he was not condemned
to pass into the House of Lords. Nothing
but the inborn consciousness of a genius for
political debate can stimulate a man to great
effort in the House of Lords. Nothing turns
upon a debate in that House. If a majority in
the House of Lords were to pass a vote of
censure three times a week on the existing
Government, that Government would continue
to exist just as if nothing had happened, and
the public in general would hardly know that
the Lords had been expressing any opinion on
the subject. An ordinary sitting of the House
of Lords is not expected to last for more than
an hour or so, and the whole assembly often
consists of some half a dozen peers. Now and
again, during the course of a session, there
is got up what may be called a full-dress debate
when some great question is disturbing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
country, and the peers think that they ought
to put on the appearance of being deeply concerned
about it, and some noble lord who has a
repute for wisdom or for eloquence gives notice
of a formal motion, and then there is a lengthened
discussion, and perhaps, on some extraordinary
occasion, the peers may sit to a late hour
and even take a division. But on such remarkable
occasions the peer who induces the House
to come together and listen to his oration is
almost sure to be one who has had his training
in the House of Commons and has made his
fame as an orator there.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot but regard it as a striking
evidence of Lord Rosebery's inborn fitness to
be an English political leader that he should
have got over the dreary discouragement of
such a training-school, and should have practiced
the art of political oratory under conditions
that might have filled Demosthenes
himself with a sense of the futility of trying to
make a great speech where nothing whatever
was likely to come of it. Lord Rosebery, however,
did succeed in proving to the House of
Lords that they had among them a brilliant
and powerful debater who had qualified himself
for success without any help from the school in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which Lord Brougham and the brilliant Lord
Derby, Lord Cairns, and Lord Salisbury had
studied and mastered the art of Parliamentary
eloquence.</p>

<p>But, indeed, Lord Rosebery appears to have
had a natural inclination to seek and find a
training-school for his abilities in places and
pursuits that might have seemed very much out
of the ordinary British aristocrat's way. Until
a comparatively recent period, we had nothing
that could be called a really decent system of
municipal government in the greater part of
London. We had, of course, the Lord Mayor
and the municipality of the City of London,
but then the City of London is only a very
small patch in the great metropolis that holds
more than five millions of people. London, outside
the City, was governed by the old-fashioned
parish vestries, and to some extent by a more
recent institution which was called the Metropolitan
Board of Works. Now, the Metropolitan
Board of Works did not manage its affairs
very well. There were disagreeable rumors and
stories about contracts and jobbing and that
sort of thing, and although matters were never
supposed to have been quite so bad as they
were in New York during days which I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
remember well, the days of Boss Tweed, there
was enough of public complaint to induce Parliament,
at the instigation of Lord Randolph
Churchill, to abolish the Board of Works altogether
and set up the London County Council,
a thoroughly representative body elected by
popular suffrage and responsible to its constituents
and the public. Lord Rosebery threw
himself heart and soul into the promotion of
this better system of London municipal government.
He became a member of the London
County Council, was elected its first Chairman,
and later on was re-elected to the same office.
Now, I think it would be hardly possible for a
man of Lord Rosebery's rank and culture and
tastes to give a more genuine proof of patriotic
public spirit than he did when he threw himself
heart and soul into the work of a municipal
council.</p>

<p>Up to that time the business of a London
municipality had been regarded as something
belonging entirely to the middle class or the
lower middle class, something with which peers
and nobles could not possibly be expected to
have anything to do. A London Alderman
had been from time out of mind a sort of figure
of fun, a vulgar, fussy kind of person, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bedizened himself in gaudy robes on festive
occasions, and was noted for his love of the
turtle in quite a different sense from that which
Byron gives to the words. Lord Rosebery set
himself steadily to the work of London municipal
government at a most critical period in its
history; his example was followed by men of
rank and culture, and some of the most intellectual
men of our day have been elected Aldermen
of the London County Council. Only think
of Frederic Harrison, the celebrated Positivist
philosopher, the man of exquisite culture and
refinement, the man of almost fastidious ways,
the scholar and the writer, becoming an Alderman
of the London County Council, and devoting
himself to the duties of his position!
Lord Rosebery undoubtedly has the honor of
having done more than any other Englishman
to raise the municipal government of London
to that position which it ought to have in the
public life of the State.</p>

<p>All that time Lord Rosebery was not neglecting
any of the other functions and occupations
which had been imposed upon him, or which he
had voluntarily taken upon himself. He held
the office of First Commissioner of Works in
one of Mr. Gladstone's administrations, an office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
involving the care of all the State buildings
and monuments and parks of the metropolis.
He was always to be seen at the private views
of the Royal Academy and the other great
picture galleries of the London season. He
was always starting some new movement for
the improvement of the breed of horses, and,
indeed, there is a certain section of our community
among whom Lord Rosebery is regarded,
not as a statesman, or a London County
Councilor, or a lover of literature, but simply
and altogether as a patron of the turf. Meanwhile
we were hearing of him every now and
then as an adventurous yachtsman, and as the
orator of some great commemoration day when
a statue was unveiled to a Burke or a Burns.</p>

<p>A more delightful host than Lord Rosebery
it would not be possible to meet or even to
imagine. I have had the honor of enjoying
his hospitality at Dalmeny and in his London
home, and I shall only say that those were
occasions which I may describe, in the words
Carlyle employed with a less gladsome significance,
as not easily to be forgotten in this
world. No man can command a greater variety
of topics of conversation. Politics, travel,
art, letters, the life of great cities, the growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of commerce, the tendencies of civilizations, the
art of living, the philosophy of life, the way to
enjoy life, the various characteristics of foreign
capitals&mdash;on all such topics Lord Rosebery
can speak with the clearness of one who knows
his subject and the vivacity of one who can put
his thoughts into the most expressive words.
I suppose there must be some eminent authors
with whose works Lord Rosebery is not familiar,
but I can only say that if there be any
such, I have not yet discovered who they are&mdash;and
I have spent a good deal of my time in
reading. I have seen Lord Rosebery in companies
where painters and sculptors and the
writers of books and the writers of plays formed
the majority, where political subjects were not
touched upon, and I have observed that Lord
Rosebery could hold his own with each practitioner
of art on the artist's special subject.
Lord Rosebery does not profess to be a bookworm
or a great scholar, but I do not know
any man better acquainted with general literature.
Such a man must surely have got out
of life all the best that it has to give.</p>

<p>Yet it is certain that the eyes of expectation
are still turned upon Lord Rosebery. There
is a general conviction that he has something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
yet to do&mdash;that, in fact, he has not yet given
his measure. He has been Prime Minister,
and he has been leader of the English Liberal
party, but in neither case had he a chance of
proving his strength. When Mr. Gladstone
made up his mind to retire finally from political
life, the Queen sent for Lord Rosebery and
invited him to form an administration. Now,
it is no secret that at that time there were men
in the Liberal party whose friends and admirers
believed that their length of service gave them
a precedence of claims over the claims of Lord
Rosebery. There were those who thought Sir
William Harcourt had won for himself a right
to be chosen as the successor to Mr. Gladstone.
On the other side&mdash;for there was grumbling
on both sides&mdash;there were members of the
Liberal administration who positively declined
to continue in office if Sir William Harcourt
were made Prime Minister. These men did
not object to serve under Sir William Harcourt
as leader of the House of Commons, but they
objected to his elevation to the supreme place
of Prime Minister. Also, there were Liberals
of great influence, who, while they had the fullest
confidence in Lord Rosebery and were not
fanatically devoted to Sir William Harcourt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
objected to the idea of having a Prime Minister
in the House of Lords, and a Prime Minister,
too, who had never sat in the House of Commons.
Now, it would be idle to deny that there
was some practical reason for this objection.
The House of Commons is the field on which
political battles are fought and won. The Commander-in-Chief
ought always to be within reach.
A whole plan of campaign may have to be
changed at a quarter of an hour's notice. It
must obviously often be highly inconvenient to
have a Prime Minister who cannot cross the
threshold of the House of Commons in order
to get into instant communication with the
leading men of his own party who are fighting
the battle.</p>

<p>At all events, I am now only concerned to
say that these doubts and difficulties and private
disputations did arise, and that, although
Lord Rosebery did accept the position of Prime
Minister, he must have done so with some
knowledge of the fact that certain of his colleagues
were not quite satisfied with the new
conditions. Lord Rosebery had been most successful
as Foreign Secretary during each term
when he held the office, but it was well known,
before Mr. Gladstone's retirement, that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
were some questions of foreign policy on which
the old leader and the new were not quite of
one opinion. In English political life, and I
suppose in the political life of every self-governing
country, there are seasons of inevitable
action and reaction which must be observed
and felt, although they cannot always be explained.</p>

<p>To a distant observer the policy of the Liberal
party might have seemed just the same
after Mr. Gladstone had retired from politics
as it was when he was in the front of political
life. But just as the policy which sustained
him in his early days as Prime Minister was
helped by the reaction which had set in against
the aggressive policy of Lord Palmerston, so
there came, with the close of Gladstone's Parliamentary
career, a kind of reaction against
his counsel of peace and moderation. Lord
Rosebery was believed to have more of what is
called the Imperialist spirit in him than had
ever guided the policy of his great leader. Certainly
some of Mr. Gladstone's former colleagues
in the House of Commons appear to
have thought so, and there began to be signs
of a growing division in the party. Lord Rosebery's
Prime Ministership lasted but a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
time. The Government sustained one or two
Parliamentary discomfitures, and there followed
upon these a positive defeat in the nature of a
sort of vote of censure carried by a small majority
against a department of the administration,
on the ground of an alleged insufficiency in
some of the supplies of ammunition for military
service. Many a Government would have professed
to think little of such a defeat, would
have treated it only as a mere question of departmental
detail, and would have gone on as
if nothing had happened. But Lord Rosebery
refused to take things so coolly and so carelessly.
Probably he was growing tired of his
position under the peculiar circumstances. Perhaps
he thought the most manly course he could
take was to give the constituencies the opportunity
of saying whether they were satisfied with
his administration or were not. The Government
appealed to the country. Parliament was
dissolved, and a general election followed. Then
was seen the full force of the reaction which
had begun to set in against the Gladstone policy
of peace, moderation, and justice. The Conservatives
came into power by a large majority.
Lord Rosebery was now merely the leader of
the Liberal party in Opposition. Even this posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>tion
he did not long retain. Some of the most
brilliant speeches he ever made in the House
of Lords were made during this time, but somehow
people began to think that his heart was
not in the leadership, and before long it was
made known to the public that he had ceased
to be the Liberal Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Everybody, of course, was ready with an explanation
as to this sudden act, and perhaps, as
sometimes happens in such cases, the less a
man really knew about the matter the more
prompt he was with his explanation. Two reasons,
however, were given by observers who
appeared likely to know something of the real
facts. One was that Lord Rosebery did not see
his way to go as far as some of his colleagues
would have gone in arousing the country to
decided action against the Ottoman Government
because of the manner in which it was
allowing its Christian subjects to be treated.
The other was that Lord Rosebery was too
Imperialistic in spirit for such men as Sir William
Harcourt and Mr. John Morley. No one
could impugn Lord Rosebery's motives in either
case. He might well have thought that too
forward a movement against Turkey might only
bring on a great European war or leave Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>land
isolated to carry out her policy at her own
risk, and in the other case he may have thought
that the policy bequeathed by Mr. Gladstone
was tending to weaken the supremacy of England
in South Africa.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery then ceased to lead a Government
or a party, and became for the time
merely a member of the House of Lords. I
do not suppose his leisure hung very heavy on
his hands. I cannot imagine Lord Rosebery
finding any difficulty in passing his day. The
only difficulty I should think such a man must
have is how to find time to give a fair chance
to all the pursuits that are dear to him. Lord
Rosebery spent some part of his leisure in
yachting, gave his usual attention to the turf,
was to be seen at picture galleries, and occasionally
addressed great public meetings on
important questions, and was a frequent visitor
to the House of Commons during each session
of Parliament. The peers have a space in the
galleries of the House of Commons set apart
for their own convenience, and, although that
space can hold but a small number of the peers,
yet on ordinary nights its benches are seldom
fully occupied. But when some great debate
is coming on, then the peers make a rush for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the gallery space in the House of Commons,
and those who do not arrive in time to get a
seat have to wait and take their chance, each
in his turn, of any vacancy which may possibly
occur. I am not a great admirer of the House
of Lords as a legislative institution, and I must
say that it has sometimes soothed the rancor of
my jealous feelings as a humble Commoner to
see a string of peers extending across the lobby
of the House of Commons, each waiting for his
chance of filling some sudden vacancy in the
peers' gallery.</p>

<p>Lord Rosebery continued to attend the debates
when he had ceased to be Prime Minister
and leader of the Liberal party just as he
had done before. His fine, clearly cut, closely
shaven face, with features that a lady novelist
of a past age would have called chiseled, and
eyes lighted with an animation that seemed to
have perpetual youth in it, were often objects
of deep interest to the members of the House,
and to the visitors in the strangers' galleries,
and no doubt in the ladies' gallery as well. The
appearance of Lord Rosebery in the peers' gallery
was sure to excite some talk among the
members of the House of Commons on the
green benches below. We were always ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to indulge in expectation and conjecture as to
what Lord Rosebery was likely to do next, for
there seemed to be a general consent of opinion
that he was the last man in the world who could
sit down and do nothing. But what was there
left for him to do? He had held various administrative
offices: he had twice been Foreign
Secretary; he had twice been Chairman of the
London County Council; he had been Prime
Minister; he had been leader of the Liberal
party; he had been President of all manner of
great institutions; he had been President of
the Social Science Congress; he had been Lord
Rector of two great Universities; he had twice
won the Derby. What was there left for him
to do which human ambition in our times and
in the dominions of Queen Victoria could care
to accomplish? Yet the general impression
seemed to be that Lord Rosebery had not yet
done his appointed work, and that impression
has grown deeper and stronger with recent
events.</p>

<p>Since the day when Lord Rosebery withdrew
from the leadership of the Liberal party the
division in that party has been growing wider
and deeper. The war in South Africa has
done much to broaden the gulf of separation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Lord Rosebery is an Imperialist, Sir William
Harcourt and Mr. John Morley are not Imperialists.
The opponents of Sir William Harcourt
and Mr. Morley call them Little Englanders.
The opponents of Lord Rosebery and those
who think with him would no doubt call them
Jingoes. The Imperialist, or, as his opponents
prefer to call him, the Jingo, accepts as the
ruling principle of his faith the right and
the duty of England to spread her civilization
and her supremacy as far as she can over all
those parts of the world which are still lying in
disorganization and in darkness. The Little
Englander, as his opponents delight to describe
him, believes that England's noblest work for a
long time to come will be found in the endeavor
to spread peace, education, and happiness
among the peoples who already acknowledge
her supremacy. I am not going to enter into
any argument as to the relative claims of the
two political schools. It has been said that a
man is born either of the school of Aristotle or
of the school of Plato. Perhaps an Englishman
of modern times is born a Jingo or a Little
Englander. I am not an Englishman, and
therefore am not called upon to rank myself on
either side of the controversy, but I know full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
well which way my instincts and sympathies
would lead me if I were compelled to choose.
I could not, therefore, account myself a political
follower of Lord Rosebery; and, indeed, on
the one great question which concerned me
most as a member of the House of Commons,
that of Irish Home Rule, Lord Rosebery is
not quite so emphatic as I should wish him to
be. I am therefore writing the eulogy, not of
Lord Rosebery the politician, but of Lord Rosebery
the orator, the scholar, the man of letters
and arts and varied culture, the man who has
done so much for public life in so many ways,
the helpful, kindly, generous friend.</p>

<p>The common impression everywhere is that
the Conservative Government, as it is now constituted,
cannot last very long. The sands of
the present Parliament are running out; the
next general election may be postponed for
some time yet, but it cannot be very far off.
Are the Liberals to come back to power with
Lord Rosebery at their head? Can the Liberal
party become so thoroughly reunited again,
Jingoes and Little Englanders, as to make the
formation of a Liberal Government a possible
event so soon? Or is it possible, as many observers
believe, that Lord Rosebery may find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
himself at the head of an administration composed
of Imperialist Liberals and the more enlightened
and generally respected members of
the present Government? I shall not venture
upon any prediction, having seen the unexpected
too often happen in politics to have
much faith in political prophecy. I note it as
an evidence of the position Lord Rosebery has
won for himself that, although he became Prime
Minister only to be defeated, and leader of the
Liberal party only to resign, he is still one of
the public men in England about whom people
are asking each other whether the time for him
to take his real position has not come at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<h2>JOSEPH CHAMBERLAIN</h2>

<p class="p2">Mr. Chamberlain was once described by an
unfriendly critic as the Rabagas of English
political life. We all remember Rabagas, the
hero of Sardou's masterpiece of dramatic satire,
who begins his public career and wins fame
among certain classes as a leveler and a demagogue
of the most advanced views, an unsparing
enemy of the aristocracy, a man who will
make no terms with the privileged orders, and
will bow to no sovereign but the sovereign people.
Now, I have said that it was an unfriendly
critic who likened Mr. Chamberlain to Sardou's
creation, but it was not in the earlier career
of the real or the imaginary politician that the
resemblance was especially to be traced. Rabagas
is brought by tempting conditions under
the influence of the privileged classes, the aristocracy,
and the reigning sovereign of the small
state in which he lives; and his leveling and
revolutionary tendencies melt away under the
genial influence of his new associations. He
becomes, before long, the admirer of the aristocracy
and the Prime Minister of the Prince,
and is ready to devote all his energies to the
defense of the privileged orders, to the repression
of the vile democracy, and the silencing
of Radical orators.</p>

<p>In this contrast between the earlier and the
later parts of the political career the malevolent
critic, no doubt, found the materials for his
comparison between Rabagas and Mr. Chamberlain.
For there can be no denying that Mr.
Chamberlain began his public life as an eloquent,
an unsparing, and apparently a convinced
champion of democracy against the aristocracy,
the privileged orders, and the Conservative
party, and that he is now a leading member of
a Conservative Government, and goes further
than most of his colleagues would be likely to
go in his hostility to Radical measures and to
Radical men.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Chamberlain, who during the
earlier part of his public life belonged to the
party most strenuously opposed to all unnecessary
wars, and especially wars which had annexation
for their object, has been the chief Ministerial
promoter of the late war in South Africa,
a war which had for its object the subjugation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of two independent republics in order to bring
them under the Imperial flag of England. No
one, therefore, could have been much surprised
when the unfriendly critic fancied that he could
discover at least a certain superficial resemblance
between the career of Rabagas and the
career of Mr. Chamberlain.</p>

<p>I have been a close observer of much of Mr.
Chamberlain's public life, and for some time we
were thrown a good deal into Parliamentary
and political association. He came into the
House of Commons not very long before I had
the honor of obtaining a seat there, and his
fame had preceded him so far that his entrance
into Parliament was looked upon by everybody
as a coming event, in the days when he had
not yet been elected to represent the constituency
of Birmingham. Birmingham was at that
time one of the most thoroughly Radical cities
in England. John Bright once said that as the
sea, wherever you dip a cup into it, will be
found to be salt, so the constituency of Birmingham,
wherever you test it, will be found
to be Radical. Birmingham could claim the
merit of being one of the best organized municipalities
in England. Its popular educational
institutions were excellent; its free libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
might have won the admiration of a citizen of
Boston, Massachusetts; its police arrangements
were efficient; its sanitation might well have
been the envy of London, and the general intelligence
of its citizens was of the highest order.
Now, it was in this enlightened, progressive, and
capable community that Mr. Chamberlain won
his first fame. He is not a Birmingham man
by birth. He was, I believe, born and brought
up on the south side of London, and was educated
at University College School, London.
But at an early age he settled in Birmingham,
and became a member of his father's manufacturing
firm there. Very soon he rose to great
distinction as a public speaker and as a member
of the local corporation, and three times
was elected chief magistrate of Birmingham.
We began soon to hear a great deal of him
in London. It must have been clear to anybody
who knew anything of Birmingham that
a man could not have risen to such distinction
in that city without great intelligence and
a marked capacity for public life. All this time
he was known as a Radical of the Radicals.
The Liberal party in London began to look
upon him as a coming man, and as a coming
man who was certain to take his place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that probably a leading place, in the advanced
Radical division of the Liberals. His political
speeches showed him to be a democrat of the
leveling order&mdash;a democrat, that is to say, of
views much more extreme than had ever been
professed by John Bright or Richard Cobden.
He was an unsparing assailant of the aristocracy
and the privileged classes, and, indeed,
went so far in his Radicalism that the Conservatives
in general regarded him as a downright
Republican.</p>

<p>I can well remember the sensation which his
first speech in the House of Commons created
among the ranks of the Tories after his election
to Parliament as one of the representatives of
Birmingham. The good Tories made no effort
to conceal their astonishment at the difference
between the real Chamberlain as they saw and
heard him and the Chamberlain of their earlier
imaginings. I talked with many of them at the
time, and was made acquainted with their emotions.
Judging from his political speeches, they
had set him down as a wild Republican, and
they expected to see a rough and shaggy man,
dressed with an uncouth disregard for the ways
of society, a sort of Birmingham Orson who
would probably scowl fiercely at his opponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in the House and would deliver his opinions in
tones of thunder. The man who rose to address
the House was a pale, slender, delicate looking,
and closely shaven personage, very neatly
dressed, with short and carefully brushed hair,
and wearing a dainty eyeglass constantly fixed
in his eye. "He looks like a ladies' doctor,"
one stout Tory murmured. "Seems like the
model of a head clerk at a West End draper's,"
observed another. Certainly there was nothing
of the Orson about this well-dressed, well-groomed
representative of the Birmingham
democracy. Mr. Chamberlain's speech made a
distinct impression on the House. It was admirably
delivered, in quietly modulated tones,
the clear, penetrating voice never rising to the
level of declamation, but never failing to reach
the ear of every listener. The political opinions
which it expressed were such as every one
might have expected to come from so resolute
a democrat, but the quiet, self-possessed
delivery greatly astonished those who had expected
to see and hear a mob orator. Mr.
Chamberlain's position in the House was assured
after that first speech. Even among the
Tories everybody felt satisfied that the new
man was a man of great ability, gifted with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
remarkable capacity for maintaining his views
with ingenious and plausible argument, a man
who could hold his own in debate with the
best, and for whom the clamors of a host of
political opponents could have no terrors.</p>

<p>I may say at once that Mr. Chamberlain has,
ever since that time, proved himself to be one
of the ablest debaters in the House of Commons.
He is not and never could be an orator
in the higher sense, for he wants altogether
that gift of imagination necessary to the composition
of an orator, and he has not the culture
and the command of ready illustration
which sometimes lift men who are not born
orators above the mere debater's highest level.
But he has unfailing readiness, a wide knowledge
of public affairs, a keen eye for all the
weak points of an opponent's case, and a flow
of clear and easy language which never fails to
give expression, at once full and precise, to all
that is in his mind. He was soon recognized,
even by his extreme political opponents, as one
of the ablest men in the House of Commons,
and it seemed plain to every one that, when
the chance came for the formation of a Liberal
Ministry, the country then being in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of a Tory Government, Mr. Chamberlain would
beyond question find a place on the Treasury
Bench.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Chamberlain's democratic
views seemed to have undergone no modification.
He was as unsparing as ever in his
denunciation of the aristocracy and the privileged
classes, and he was especially severe
upon the great landowners, and used to propound
schemes for buying them out by the
State and converting their land into national
property. His closest ally and associate in
Parliamentary politics was Sir Charles Dilke,
who had entered the House of Commons some
years before Mr. Chamberlain, and who was
then, as he is now, an advanced and determined
Radical. Sir Charles Dilke, in fact, was
at that time supposed to be something very
like a Republican, at least in theory, and he
had been exciting great commotion in several
parts of the country by his outspoken complaints
about the vast sums of money voted
every year for the Royal Civil List. It was
but natural that Sir Charles Dilke and Mr.
Chamberlain should become close associates,
and there was a general conviction that the
more advanced section of the Liberal party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
was destined to take the command in Liberal
politics.</p>

<p>Outside the range of strictly English politics
there was a question arising which threatened
to make a new division in the Liberal
party. This was the question of Home Rule
for Ireland as it presented itself under the
leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell. For
years the subject of Home Rule had been the
occasion, under the leadership of Mr. Butt,
of nothing more formidable to the House of
Commons than an annual debate and division.
Once in every session Mr. Butt brought forward
a motion calling for a measure of Home
Rule for Ireland, and, after some eloquent
speeches made in favor of the motion by Irish
members, a few speeches were delivered on the
other side by the opponents of Home Rule,
Liberals as well as Tories, and then some leading
member of the Government went through
the form of explaining why the motion could
not be accepted. A division was taken, and Mr.
Butt's motion was found to have the support
of the very small Irish Nationalist party, as it
then was, and perhaps half a dozen English or
Scotch Radicals; and the whole House of Commons,
except for these, declared against Home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Rule. About the time, however, of Mr. Chamberlain's
entrance on the field of politics a
great change had taken place in the conditions
of the Home Rule question. Charles Stewart
Parnell had become in fact, although not yet
in name, the leader of the Irish National party,
and Parnell's tactics were very different indeed
from those of his nominal leader, Mr. Butt.
Butt was a man who had great reverence for
old constitutional forms and for the traditions
and ways of the House of Commons, and he had
faith in the power of mere argument to bring
the House some time or other to see the
justice of his cause. Parnell was convinced
that there was only one way of compelling the
House of Commons to pay any serious attention
to the Irish demand, and that was by
making it clear to the Government and the
House that until they had turned their full
attention to the Irish national claims, they
should not be allowed to turn their attention
to any other business whatever. Therefore he
introduced that policy of obstruction which
has since become historical, and which for a
time literally convulsed the House of Commons.
Now, I am not going again into the
oft-told tale of Home Rule and the obstruc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>tion
policy, and I touch upon the subject here
only because of its direct connection with the
career of Mr. Chamberlain. Sir Charles Dilke
and Mr. Chamberlain supported Mr. Parnell in
most of his assaults upon the Tory Government.
It was Parnell's policy to bring forward
some motion, during the discussion of the estimates
for the army and navy or for the civil
service, which should raise some great and
important question of controversy connected
only in a technical sense with the subject formally
before the House, and thus to raise a
prolonged debate which had the effect of postponing
to an indefinite time the regular movement
of business. Thus he succeeded in stopping
all the regular work of the House until
the particular motion in which he was concerned
had been fully discussed and finally settled,
one way or the other. It was by action
of this kind that he succeeded in prevailing
upon the House of Commons to condemn the
barbarous system of flogging in the army and
the navy, and finally to obtain its abolition. In
this latter course he was warmly supported by
Mr. Chamberlain and Sir Charles Dilke, and
by many other Liberal members.</p>

<p>But it was not only in obstructive motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
which concerned the common interests of the
country that Parnell obtained the support of
Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain. These
two men boldly and vigorously maintained him
in his policy of obstruction when it only professed
to concern itself with Irish national questions.
They identified themselves so thoroughly
with his Irish policy that it became a familiar
joke in the House of Commons to describe
Dilke and Chamberlain as the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General of the Home
Rule party. I was then a member of the
House, and had been elected Vice-President of
the Irish party, Parnell being, of course, the
President. Naturally, I was brought closely
into association with Mr. Chamberlain, and I
had for many years been a personal friend of
Sir Charles Dilke. Again and again I heard
Mr. Chamberlain express his entire approval of
the obstructive policy adopted by Parnell, and
declare that that was the only way by which
Parnell could compel the House of Commons
to give a hearing to the Irish claims. Mr.
Chamberlain, indeed, expressed, on more than
one occasion, in speeches delivered during a
debate in the House, just the same opinion
as to Parnell's course which I had heard him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
utter in private conversation. In one of these
speeches I remember well his generous declaration
that he was sorry he had not had an opportunity
of expressing that opinion to the House
of Commons long before. Now, of course, I
always thought, and still think, that all this was
much to the credit of Mr. Chamberlain's political
intelligence, courage, and manly feeling,
and I regarded him as one of the truest English
friends the Home Rule cause had ever
made. I had the opportunity, on more than
one occasion, of hearing Dilke and Chamberlain
define their respective positions on the
subject of Home Rule. Dilke regarded Home
Rule as an essential part of a federal system,
which he believed to be absolutely necessary to
the safety, strength, and prosperity of the British
Empire. He would have made it a Federal
system, by virtue of which each member of the
Imperial organization governed its own domestic
affairs in its own way, while the common
wishes and interests of the Empire were represented,
discussed, and arranged in a central
Imperial Parliament. Therefore, even if the
Irish people had not been themselves awakened
to the necessity for a Home Rule Legislature
in Ireland, Dilke would have been in favor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
urging on them the advantages of such an
arrangement. This, in point of fact, is the system
which has made the Canadian and the
Australasian provinces what they are at this
day, contented, loyal, and prosperous members
of the Imperial system. Chamberlain was not
so convinced an advocate of the general system
of Home Rule as Dilke, but he was always emphatic
in his declarations that, if the large majority
of the Irish people desired Home Rule,
their desire should be granted to them by the
Imperial Parliament.</p>

<p>When I first entered the House of Commons,
the Conservative party was in office. About a
year after, the general election of 1880 came
on, almost in the ordinary course of events,
and the result of the appeal to the country was
that the Liberals came back to power with a
large majority. Mr. Gladstone was at the head
of the Liberal party, and he became Prime
Minister. Everybody assumed that two such
prominent Radicals as Dilke and Chamberlain
could not be overlooked by the new Prime
Minister in his arrangements to form an administration.
I think I am entitled to say, as a
positive fact, that Dilke and Chamberlain entered
into an understanding between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>selves
that unless one at least of them was
offered a place in the Cabinet, neither would
accept office of any kind. Of course when a
new Government is in process of formation all
these arrangements are matters of private discussion
and negotiation with the men at the
head of affairs; and the result of interchange
of ideas in this instance was that Chamberlain
became President of the Board of Trade, with
a seat in the Cabinet, and Dilke accepted the
office of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
without a place in the inner Ministerial circle.
This was done, not only with Dilke's cordial
consent, but at his express wish, for it was his
strong desire that the higher place in the
administration should be given to his friend.</p>

<p>Now, at this time Mr. Gladstone was not a
convinced Home Ruler. I know that the importance
of the question was entering his mind
and was absorbing much of his attention. I
know that he was earnestly considering the
subject, and that his mind was open to conviction;
but I know also that he was not yet
convinced. Chamberlain, therefore, would apparently
have had nothing to gain if he merely
desired to conciliate the favor of his leader by
still putting himself forward as the friend and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the ally of the Home Rule party. But he continued,
when in office, to be just as openly our
friend as he had been in the days when he was
only an ordinary member of the House of Commons.
There were times when, owing to the
policy of coercion pursued in Ireland by the
then Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant,
the relations between the Liberal Government
and the Home Rule party were severely strained.
We did battle many a time as fiercely against
Mr. Gladstone's Government as ever we had
done against the Government of his Tory predecessor.
Yet Mr. Chamberlain always remained
our friend and our adviser, always stood by us
whenever he could fairly be expected to do so
in public, and always received our confidences
in private. When Mr. Parnell and other members
of our party were thrown into Dublin
prison, Mr. Chamberlain did his best to obtain
justice and fair treatment for them and for the
Home Rule cause and for the Irish people.</p>

<p>Many American readers will probably have
a recollection of what was called the Kilmainham
Treaty&mdash;the "Treaty" being an arrangement
which it was thought might be honorably
agreed upon between Mr. Gladstone and the
leaders of the Irish party, and by virtue of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
an improved system of land-tenure legislation
was to be given to Ireland, on the one hand,
and every effort was to be made to restore
peace to Ireland on the other. I do not intend
to go into this old story at any length, my only
object being to record the fact that the whole
arrangements were conducted between Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr. Parnell, and that Chamberlain
was still understood to be the friend of
Ireland and of Home Rule. These negotiations
led to the resignation of office by the late
Mr. William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary
to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and then
came the important question, Who was likely
to be put in Mr. Forster's place? I believe
that, as a matter of fact, the place was offered,
in the first instance, to Sir Charles Dilke, but
was declined by him on the ground that he was
not also offered a seat in the Cabinet, and Dilke
was convinced that unless he had a seat in the
Cabinet he could have no chance of pressing
successfully on the Government his policy of
Home Rule for Ireland.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain then had reason to believe
that the office would be tendered to him, and
he was willing to accept it and to do the best
he could. I know that he believed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
place was likely to be offered to him and that
he was ready to undertake its duties, for he
took the very frank and straightforward course
of holding a conference with certain Irish Nationalist
members to whom he made known
his views on the subject. The Irish members
whom he consulted understood clearly from
him that if he went to Ireland in the capacity
of Chief Secretary he would go as a Home
Ruler and would expect their co-operation and
their assistance. There was no secret about
this conference. It was held within the precincts
of the House of Commons, and Mr.
Chamberlain's action in suggesting and conducting
it was entirely becoming and proper
under the conditions. For some reason or other,
which I at least have never heard satisfactorily
explained, the office of Chief Secretary was
given, after all, to the late Lord Frederick Cavendish.
Then followed the terrible tragedy of
the Phoenix Park, Dublin, when Lord Frederick
and Mr. Thomas Burke, his official subordinate,
were murdered in the open day by a gang of
assassins. When the news of this appalling
deed reached London, Mr. Parnell and I went
at once, and as a matter of course, to consult
with Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. Chamberlain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
as to the steps which ought to be taken in
order to vindicate the Irish people from any
charge of sympathy with so wanton and so
atrocious a crime. We saw both Dilke and
Chamberlain and consulted with them, and I
can well remember being greatly impressed by
the firmness with which Mr. Chamberlain declared
that nothing which had happened would
prevent him from accepting the office of Chief
Secretary in Ireland if the opportunity were
offered to him. I go into all this detail with
the object of making it clear to the reader that,
up to this time, Mr. Chamberlain had the full
confidence of the Irish Nationalist party and
was understood by them to be in thorough sympathy
with them as to Ireland's demand for
Home Rule.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain did not, however, become
Irish Secretary, but retained his position as
President of the Board of Trade, and many
foreign troubles began in Egypt and other
parts of the world which diverted the attention
of Parliament and the public for a while from
questions of purely domestic policy. Mr. Gladstone,
however, succeeded in carrying through
Parliament a sort of new reform bill which reconstructed
the constituencies, expanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
electorate, and, in fact, set up in the three countries
something approaching nearly to the old
Chartist idea of equal electoral division and
universal suffrage. The foreign troubles, however,
were very serious, the Government lost its
popularity, and at last was defeated on one of
its financial proposals and resigned office. The
Tories came into power for a short time. Mr.
Chamberlain stumped the country in his old
familiar capacity as a Radical politician of the
extreme school, and he started a scheme of
policy which was commonly described afterwards
as the unauthorized programme, in which
he advocated, among other bold reforms, a peasant
proprietary throughout the country by the
compulsory purchase of land, the effect of which
would be to endow every deserving peasant
with at least three acres and a cow. The Tories
were not able to do anything in office, owing
to the combined attacks made upon them by
the Radicals and the Irish Home Rulers, and
in 1886 another dissolution of Parliament took
place and a general election came on. The
effect of the latest reform measure introduced
by Mr. Gladstone now told irresistibly in Mr.
Gladstone's favor, and the newly arranged constituencies
sent him back into office and into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
power. Mr. Chamberlain once again joined
Mr. Gladstone's Government, and became President
of the Local Government Board.</p>

<p>Then comes a sudden change in the story.
The extension of the suffrage gave, for the
first time, a large voting power into the hands
of the majority of the Irish people, for in Ireland
up to that date the right to vote had been
enjoyed only by the landlord class and the well-to-do
middle class; and the result of the new
franchise was that Ireland sent into Parliament
an overwhelming number of Home Rule Representatives
to follow the leadership of Parnell.
Gladstone then became thoroughly satisfied
that the vast majority of the Irish people were
in favor of Home Rule, and he determined to
introduce a measure which should give to Ireland
a separate domestic Parliament. Thereupon
Mr. Chamberlain suddenly announced
that he could not support such a measure of
Home Rule, and it presently came out that he
could not support any measure of Home Rule.
He resigned his place in Mr. Gladstone's Government,
and he became from that time not
only an opponent of Home Rule but a proclaimed
Conservative and anti-Radical. When
a Tory Government was formed, after the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>feat
of Mr. Gladstone's first Home Rule measure,
Mr. Chamberlain became a member of the
Tory Government, and he is one of the leading
members of a Tory Government at this day.</p>

<p>Now, it is for this reason, I suppose, that the
unfriendly critic, of whom I have already spoken
more than once, thought himself justified in
describing Mr. Chamberlain as the Rabagas of
English political life. It is, indeed, hard for
any of us to understand the meaning of Mr.
Chamberlain's sudden change. At the opening
of 1886 he was, what he had been during
all his previous political life, a flaming democrat
and Radical. In the early months of 1886
he was a flaming Tory and anti-Radical. During
several years of frequent association with
him in the House of Commons I had always
known him as an advocate of Home Rule for
Ireland, and all of a sudden he exhibited himself
as an uncompromising opponent of Home
Rule. Many English Liberal members objected
to some of the provisions of Mr. Gladstone's
first Home Rule Bill, but when these
objections were removed in Mr. Gladstone's
second Home Rule Bill they returned at once
to their places under his leadership. But Mr.
Chamberlain would have nothing to do with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
any manner of Home Rule measure, and when
he visited the province of Ulster in the north
of Ireland he delighted all the Ulster Orangemen
by the fervor of his speeches against Home
Rule. Moreover, it may fairly be asked why
an English Radical and democrat of extreme
views must needs become an advocate of Toryism
all along the line simply because he has
ceased to be in favor of Home Rule for Ireland.
These are questions which I, at least, cannot
pretend to answer.</p>

<p>Of course we have in history many instances
of conversions as sudden and as complete, about
the absolute sincerity of which even the worldly
and cynical critic has never ventured a doubt.
There was the conversion of Constantine the
Great, and there was the sudden change brought
about in the feelings and the life of Ignatius of
Loyola. But then somehow Mr. Chamberlain
does not seem to have impressed on his contemporaries,
either before or after his great
change, the idea that he was a man cast exactly
in the mold of a Constantine or an Ignatius.
Only of late years has he been dubbed with the
familiar nickname of "Pushful Joe," but he was
always set down as a man of personal ambition,
determined to make his way well on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
world. We had all made up our minds, somehow,
that he would be content to push his fortunes
on that side of the political field to which,
up to that time, he had proclaimed himself to
belong, and it never occurred to us to think of
him as the associate of Tory dukes, as a leading
member of a Tory Government, and as the
champion of Tory principles. Men have in all
ages changed their political faith without exciting
the world's wonder. Mr. Gladstone began
as a Tory, and grew by slow degrees into a
Radical. Two or three public men in our own
days who began as moderate Liberals have
gradually turned into moderate Tories. But
Mr. Chamberlain's conversion was not like any
of these. It was accomplished with a suddenness
that seemed to belong to the days
when miracles were yet worked upon the earth.
Mr. Chamberlain may well feel proud in the
consciousness that the close attention of the
political world will follow with eager curiosity
his further career.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<h2>HENRY LABOUCHERE</h2>

<p class="p2">Henry Labouchere is the most amusing
speaker in the House of Commons. Eclipse
is first and there is no second&mdash;to adopt the
words once used by Lord Macaulay&mdash;at least,
if there be a second, I do not feel myself qualified
for the task of designating him. It is
hardly necessary to say that whenever Labouchere
rises in the House of Commons&mdash;and
he rises very often in the course of a session&mdash;he
is sure of an immediate hearing. He seldom
addresses himself to any subject with the
outward appearance of seriousness. He always
puts his argument in jesting form; sends a
shower of sparkling words over the most solemn
controversy; puts on the manner of one
who has plunged into the debate only for the
mere fun of the thing; and brings his display
to an end just at the time when the House
hopes that he is only beginning to exert himself
for its amusement. I do not know that he
has ever made what could be called a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
speech, and I think I may fairly assume that
he has never made a speech which his audience
would not have wished to be a little
longer.</p>

<p>Now, I must say at once that it would be
the most complete misappreciation of Henry
Labouchere's character and purpose to regard
him as a mere jester, or even a mere humorist
endowed with the faculty of uttering spontaneous
witticisms. Labouchere is very much
in earnest even when he makes a joke, and his
sharpest cynicism is inspired by a love of justice
and a desire to champion the cause of
what he believes to be the right. I heard him
once make a speech in the House of Commons
on behalf of some suffering class or
cause, and when coming to a close he suddenly
said: "I may be told that this is a sentimental
view of the case; but, Mr. Speaker, I
am a man of sentiment." The House broke
into a perfect chorus of laughter at the idea
thus presented of Labouchere as a man of sentiment.
Probably many, or most, of his listeners
thought it was only Labouchere's fun,
and merely another illustration of his love for
droll paradox. I have no doubt that Labouchere
knew very well in advance what sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
reception was likely to be given to his description
of himself, and that he heartily enjoyed
the effect it produced. But, all the same, there
was a good deal of truth in the description. I
have always regarded Labouchere as a man
of intensely strong opinions, whose peculiar
humor it is to maintain these opinions by sarcasm
and witticism and seeming paradox.</p>

<p>Certainly no public man in England has
given clearer evidence of his sincerity and
disinterestedness in any cause that he advocates
than Labouchere has done again and
again. I remember hearing it said many years
ago in New York of my old friend Horace
Greeley that whereas some other editors of
great newspapers backed up their money with
their opinions, Greeley backed up his opinions
with his money. The meaning, of course, was
that while some editors shaped their opinions
in order to make their journals profitable, Horace
Greeley was ready to sacrifice his money for
the sake of maintaining the newspaper which
expressed his sincere convictions. Something
of the same kind might fairly be said of Henry
Labouchere. He is the proprietor and editor
of the weekly newspaper "Truth," in which he
expresses his own opinions without the slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>est
regard for the commercial interests of the
paper, or, indeed, for the political interests of
the party which he usually supports in the
House of Commons. I believe that, as a matter
of fact, "Truth" is a most successful enterprise,
even as a commercial speculation, for
everybody wants to know what it is likely to
say on this or that new and exciting question,
and nobody can tell in advance what view
Labouchere's organ may be likely to take.
Labouchere has, however, given proof many
times that he keeps up his newspaper as the
organ of his individual opinions, and not
merely as a means of making money or sustaining
the interests of a political party. He
has again and again hunted out and hunted
down evil systems of various kinds, shams and
quacks of many orders, abuses affecting large
masses of the poor and the lowly, and has
rendered himself liable to all manner of legal
actions for the recovery of damages. If, because
of some technical or other failure in his
defense to one of those legal actions, Labouchere
is cast in heavy damages, he pays the
amount, makes a jest or two about it, and goes
to work at the collection of better evidence
and at the hunting out of other shams with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
as cheery a countenance as if nothing particular
had happened. Fortunately for himself,
and, I think, also very fortunately for the public
in general, Labouchere is personally a rich
man, and is able to meet without inconvenience
any loss which may be brought upon him now
and then by his resolute endeavors to expose
shams.</p>

<p>Labouchere spent ten years of his earlier
manhood in the diplomatic service, and was
attaché at various foreign courts and at Washington.
He had always a turn for active political
life, and entered the House of Commons in
1865, and in 1880 was elected as one of the
representatives for the constituency of Northampton.
His colleague at that time in the
representation of the constituency was the once
famous Charles Bradlaugh. It would not be
easy to find a greater contrast in appearance
and manners, in education and social bringing
up, than that presented by the two representatives
of Northampton. Labouchere is a man
of barely medium stature; Bradlaugh's proportions
approached almost to the gigantic. One
could not talk for five minutes with Labouchere
and fail to know, even if they had never
met before, that Labouchere was a man born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and trained to the ways of what is called good
society; Bradlaugh was evidently a child of
the people, who had led a hard and roughening
life, and had had to make his way by
sheer toil and unceasing exertion. Bradlaugh
as a public speaker was powerful and commanding
in his peculiar style&mdash;the style of
the workingman's platform and of the open-air
meetings in Hyde Park. He had tremendous
lungs, a voice of surprising power and volume,
and his speeches were all attuned to the tone
of open-air declamation. Most observers, even
among those who thoroughly recognized his
great intellectual power and his command of
language, would have taken it for granted beforehand
that he never could suit himself to
the atmosphere of the House of Commons.
Labouchere's speeches, even when delivered to
a large public meeting, were pitched in a conversational
key, and he never attempted a
declamatory flight. His speeches within the
House of Commons and outside it always
sparkled with droll and humorous illustrations,
and when he was most in earnest he seemed
to be making a joke of the whole business.
Bradlaugh was always terribly in earnest, and
seemed as if he were determined to bear down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
all opposition by the power of his arguments
and the volume of his voice. In Labouchere
you always found the man accustomed to the
polished ways of diplomatic circles; in Bradlaugh
one saw the typical champion of the
oppressed working class. Labouchere comes,
as his name would suggest, from a French
Huguenot family of old standing; Bradlaugh
was thoroughly British in style even when he
advocated opinions utterly opposed to those of
the average Briton.</p>

<p>The House of Commons is, on the whole,
a fair-minded assembly, and even those who
were most uncompromising in their hostility
to some of Bradlaugh's views came soon to
recognize that by his election to Parliament
the House had obtained a new and powerful
debater. Both men soon won recognition from
the House for their very different characteristics
as debaters, and at one time I think that
the college-bred country gentlemen of the Tory
ranks were inclined, on the whole, to find
more fault with Labouchere than with Bradlaugh.
They seemed willing to make allowances
for Bradlaugh which they would not
make for his colleague in the representation
of Northampton. One can imagine their rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>soning
out the matter somewhat in this way:
This man Bradlaugh comes from the working
class, is not in any sense belonging to our
order, and we must take all that into account;
while this other man, Labouchere, is of our
own class, has had his education at Eton, has
been trained among diplomatists in foreign
courts, is in fact a gentleman, and yet is constantly
proclaiming his hostility to all the
established institutions of his native country.
Even the Tory country gentlemen, however,
found it impossible wholly to resist the wit,
the sarcasms, and the droll humors of Labouchere,
and whenever he spoke in the House
he was sure to have attentive listeners on all
the rows of benches.</p>

<p>Bradlaugh's actual Parliamentary career did
not last very long. When he was first elected
for Northampton, he refused to take the oath
of allegiance, on the ground that he could not
truthfully make that appeal to the higher power
with which the oath concludes. He was willing
to make an affirmation, but the majority of
the House would not accept the compromise.
A considerable period of struggle intervened.
The seat was declared to be vacant, but Mr.
Bradlaugh was promptly re-elected by the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>stituents
of Northampton, and then there set
in a dispute between the House and the constituency
something like that which, in the
days of Daniel O'Connell, ended in Catholic
emancipation. Bradlaugh was enabled to enter
the House in 1886, and he made himself very
conspicuous in debate. His manners were remarkably
courteous, and he became popular
after a while even among those who held his
political and religious opinions in the utmost
abhorrence. His career was closed in 1891 by
death.</p>

<p>I can well remember my first meeting with
Henry Labouchere. It was at a dinner party
given by my friend Sir John R. Robinson, then
and until quite lately manager of the London
"Daily News." The dinner was given at the
Reform Club, and took place, I think, some
time before Labouchere's election for Northampton.
I had never seen Labouchere before
that time, and had somehow failed to learn his
name before we sat down to dinner. We were
not a large party, and the conversation was
general. I was soon impressed by the vivid
and unstrained humor of Labouchere's talk
and by the peculiarity of his manner. He
spoke his sentences in quiet, slow, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
languid tones; there was nothing whatever of
the "agreeable rattle" in his demeanor; he
had no appearance of any determination to be
amusing, or even consciousness of any power
to amuse. He always spoke without effort and
with the air of one who would just as soon
have remained silent if he did not happen to
have something to say, and whatever he did
say in his languorous tones was sure to hold
the attention and to delight the humorous faculties
of every listener. My curiosity was
quickly aroused and promptly satisfied as to
the identity of this delightful talker, and thus
began my acquaintanceship with Labouchere,
which has lasted ever since, and is, I hope,
likely to last for some time longer. Labouchere
is a wonderful teller of stories drawn
from his various experiences in many parts of
the world, and, unlike most other story-tellers,
he is never heard to repeat an anecdote, unless
when he was especially invited to do so for the
benefit of some one who had not had an opportunity
of hearing it before. If he were only
a teller of good stories and an utterer of witty
sayings, he would well deserve a place in the
social history of England during our times;
but Labouchere's skill as a talker is one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
least considerable claims upon public attention.
Nature endowed Labouchere with what might
be called a fighting spirit, and I believe that
whenever he sees any particular cause or body
of men apparently put under conditions of disadvantage,
his first instinctive inclination is to
make himself its advocate, so far at least as to
insist that the cause or the men must have a
fair hearing.</p>

<p>In the House of Commons it could not have
happened very often that Henry Labouchere
was found on the side of the strong battalions.
I know that during the heaviest and the fiercest
struggles of the Irish National party against
coercive laws and in favor of Ireland's demand
for Home Rule, Henry Labouchere was always
found voting with us in the division lobby.
Some of those days were very dark indeed.
Before Gladstone had become converted to the
principle of Home Rule for Ireland, and before
the later changes in the system of Parliamentary
representation had given an extended popular
suffrage to the Irish constituencies, the
number of Irish representatives who followed
the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell was
for many sessions not more than seven or eight.
There were some English members who always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
voted with us, and conspicuous and constant
among these were Sir Wilfred Lawson and
Henry Labouchere. Unquestionably neither
Labouchere nor Lawson had anything whatever
to gain in Parliamentary or worldly sense
by identifying himself with our efforts in the
House of Commons. As soon as Ireland got
her fair share of the popular franchise, Parnell
was followed by some eighty or ninety members
out of the hundred and three who constitute
the whole Irish representation. This was
the very fact which first brought Gladstone,
as I heard from his own lips, to see that the
demand of Ireland was in every sense a thoroughly
national demand, and that the whole
principle of the British constitution claimed for
it the consideration of genuine statesmanship.
Labouchere had identified himself with the
national cause in the days before that cause
had yet found anything like representation in
the House of Commons. Through all his political
career he remained faithful to that principle
of nationality, and in the time&mdash;I hope
not distant&mdash;when the Irish claim for Home
Rule is recognized and accepted by the British
Parliament, Ireland is not likely to forget that
Henry Labouchere was one of the very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
English members who recognized and championed
her claim in the hour when almost every
man's hand was against it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the inborn spirit of adventure which
makes itself so apparent in Labouchere's temperament
and career may have had something
to do with his championship of the oppressed.
I do not say this with any intention to disparage
Labouchere's genuine desire to uphold what
he believes to be the right, but only to illustrate
the peculiarities of his nature. Certainly
his love of adventure has made itself conspicuous
and impressive at many stages of his varied
career. There is a legend to the effect that
Labouchere joined at one time the company of
a traveling circus in the United States for the
novelty and amusement of the enterprise. I
do not know whether there is any truth in this
story, but I should certainly be quite prepared
to believe it on anything like authentic evidence.
The adventure would seem quite in
keeping with the temper of the man. Most of
us know what happened when the Germans
were besieging Paris during the war of 1870.
It suddenly occurred to Labouchere that it
would be a most interesting chapter in a man's
life if he were to spend the winter in the be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>sieged
city. No sooner said, or thought, than
done. Labouchere was then one of the proprietors
of the London "Daily News," and he
announced his determination to undertake the
task of representing that journal in Paris as
long as the siege should last. Of course he
obtained full authority for the purpose, and he
contrived to make his way into Paris, and when
there he relieved the regular correspondent of
the "Daily News" from his wearisome and
perilous work by sending him off, in a balloon,
I believe, to Tours, where he was out of the
range of the German forces, and could continue
his daily survey of events in general. Then
Labouchere set himself down to enjoy all the
hardships of the siege, to live on the flesh of
horse and donkey and even cat and rat, to
endure the setting in of utter darkness when
once the sun had gone down, and to chronicle
a daily account of his strange experiences. This
was accomplished in his "Diary of a Besieged
Resident," which appeared from day to day in
the columns of the "Daily News," and was
afterwards published as a volume, and a most
entertaining, humorous, realistic, and delightful
volume it made. The very difficulties of its
transmission by means of balloons and pigeons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and other such floating or flying agencies must
have been a constant source of amusement
and excitement to the adventurous besieged
resident.</p>

<p>Labouchere has always been in the habit of
seeking excitement by enterprises on the Stock
Exchange. I do not believe that these ventures
have been made with the commonplace
desire to make money, but I can quite understand
that they are prompted by the very same
desire for new experiences which prompted the
residence in besieged Paris. I remember meeting
Labouchere one day many years ago in a
West End London street, and being told by
him that he had just incurred a very heavy loss
by one of his financial ventures on the Stock
Exchange. He told me in his usual tones of
almost apathetic languor the amount of his
loss, and it seemed to my modest experiences in
money affairs to be a positive fortune sacrificed.
He was smiling blandly while recounting his
adventure, and I could not help asking him how
he had felt when the loss was first made known
to him. "Well," he replied, in the same good-humored
tone, "it was an experience, like another."
That, I think, is a fair illustration of
Labouchere's governing mood. The great thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was to get a new sensation. At one time Labouchere
became the founder and the owner of
a new theater in London, and he took part in
many a newspaper enterprise. He was, as I
have said, for a long time one of the proprietors
of the "Daily News," and he entered into
that proprietorship at the very time when the
"Daily News" was making itself most unpopular
in capitalist circles and in what is known
as society, by its resolute and manly adherence
to the side of the Federal States during the
great American Civil War. It suited Labouchere's
pluck and temper to join in such an
undertaking at the time when the odds seemed
all against it; and it is only fair to say that I
am sure no love for a new sensation could
induce Labouchere to take up any cause which
he did not believe to be the cause of right.</p>

<p>Labouchere was one of those who went in
with the late Edmund Yates in founding "The
World," then quite a new venture as a society
journal. Labouchere, however, did not long
remain a sharer in this enterprise. Yates was
the editor of the paper, and Yates went in altogether
for satirical or at least amusing pictures
of West End life, and did not care anything
about politics and the struggles of this or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
political movement. Labouchere could not
settle down to any interest in a newspaper
which dealt only with changes of fashion and
the whimsicalities of social life. His close
interest in political questions filled him with
the resolve to start a journal which, while dealing
with the personages and the ways of society,
should also be the organ of his own views
on graver subjects. He therefore withdrew
from all concern in Edmund Yates's "World"
and started his own weekly newspaper, "Truth,"
which has since enjoyed a life of vigor and success.
There is room enough for both papers
apparently. The "World" has not lost its
circle of readers, while "Truth" is beyond question
a great power in political and financial as
well as in social movements.</p>

<p>One of Labouchere's special delights is to
expose in "Truth" some successful adventurer
in pretentious financial schemes, some hypocritical
projector of sham philanthropic institutions,
some charlatan with whom, because of
his temporary influence and success, most other
people are unwilling to try conclusions. Such
an impostor is just the sort of man whom Labouchere
is delighted to encounter. Labouchere's
plan is simple and straightforward. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
publishes an article in "Truth" containing the
most direct and explicit charges of imposture
and fraud against the man whom he has determined
to expose, and he invites this man to
bring an action against him in a court of law
and obtain damages, if he can, for slander.
Labouchere usually intimates politely that he
will not avail himself of any preliminary and
technical forms which might interpose unnecessary
delay, and that he will do all in his
power as defendant to facilitate and hasten
the trial of the action. It happens in many or
most cases that the personage thus invited to
appeal to a court of law cautiously refrains
from accepting the invitation. He knows that
Labouchere has plenty of money, perceives that
he is not to be frightened out of his allegations,
and probably thinks the safest course is to
treat "Truth" and its owner with silent contempt.
Sometimes, however, the accused man
accepts battle in a court of law, and the attention
of the public is riveted on the hearing of
the case. Perhaps Labouchere fails to make
out every one of his charges, and then the result
is formally against him and he may be
cast in damages, but he cares nothing for the
cost and is probably well satisfied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
knowledge that he has directed the full criticism
of the public to the general character of
his opponent's doings and has made it impossible
for the opponent to work much harm in
the future. Even the strongest political antagonists
of Labouchere have been found ready
to admit that he has rendered much service
to the public by his resolute efforts to expose
shams and quackeries of various kinds at whatever
pecuniary risk or cost to himself.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it would be quite
consistent with the realities of the situation if
I were to describe Labouchere as a favorite in
the House of Commons. He has provoked so
many enmities, he has made so many enemies
by his sharp sarcasms, his unsparing ridicule,
and his sometimes rather heedless personalities,
that a great many members of the House
must be kept in a state of chronic indignation
towards him. A man who arouses a feeling of
this kind and keeps it alive among a considerable
number of his brother members could
hardly be described with strict justice as a
favorite in the House of Commons. Yet it is
quite certain that there is no man in the House
whose sayings are listened to with a keener
interest, and whose presence would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
generally missed if he were to retire from public
life.</p>

<p>One of the many stories which I have heard
about Labouchere's peculiar ways when he was
in the diplomatic service is worth repeating
here. It has never been contradicted, so far as
I know. When Labouchere was attaché to the
British Legation at Washington&mdash;it was then
only a Legation&mdash;his room was invaded one
day by an indignant John Bull, fresh from
England, who had some grievance to bring
under the notice of the British Minister. That
eminent personage was not then in the house,
and the man with the grievance was shown into
Labouchere's room. Labouchere was smoking
a cigarette, according to his custom, and he
received the visitor blandly, but without any
effusive welcome. John Bull declared that he
must see the Minister at once, and Labouchere
mildly responded that the British Minister was
not in the Legation buildings. "When will
he return?" was the next demand, to which
Labouchere could only make answer that he
really did not know. "Then," declared the
resolute British citizen, "I have only to say that
I shall wait here until he returns." Labouchere
signified his full concurrence with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
proposal, and graciously invited his countryman
to take a chair, and then went on with his
reading and noting of letters and his cigarette
just as before. Hours glided away, and no
further word was exchanged. At last the hour
came for closing the official rooms, and Labouchere
began to put on his coat and make preparations
for a speedy departure. The visitor
thereupon saw that the time had come for
some decided movement on his part, and he
sternly put to Labouchere the question, "Can
you tell me where the British Minister is just
now?" Labouchere replied, with his usual
unruffled composure, "I really cannot tell you
exactly where he is just now, but I should
think he must be nearly halfway across the
Atlantic, as he left New York for England last
Saturday." Up rose John Bull in fierce indignation,
and exclaimed, "You never told me
that he had left for England." "You never
asked me the question," Labouchere made answer,
with undisturbed urbanity, and the visitor
had nothing for it but to go off in storm.</p>

<p>Labouchere is the possessor of a beautiful
and historic residence on the banks of the
Thames&mdash;Pope's famous villa at Twickenham.
There he is in the habit of entertaining his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
friends during the summer months, and there
one is sure to meet an interesting and amusing
company. I have had the pleasure of being
his guest many times, and I need hardly say
that I have always found such visits delightful.
Labouchere is a most charming host, and although
he is himself a wonderful talker, full
of anecdote and reminiscence, he never fails
to see that the conversation is thoroughly diffused,
and that no guest is left out of the
talk. In London he always mixes freely with
society, and his London home is ever hospitable.
Many of his friends were strongly of
opinion that he ought to have been invited to
become a member of a Liberal administration.
I suppose, however, that most of the solid and
steady personages who form a Cabinet would
have been rather alarmed at the idea of so
daring and damaging a free lance being appointed
to a high place in the official ranks of
a Government, and it would have been out
of the question to think of offering any subordinate
position to so brilliant a master of
Parliamentary debate. For myself I do not
feel any regret that Labouchere, so far, has not
taken any place in an administration. He has
made his fame as a free lance, and has done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
efficient public work in that capacity, such as
he could hardly have accomplished if he had
been set down to the regular and routine duties
of an official post. He has made a name for
himself by his independent support of every
cause and movement which he believed to have
justice on its side, and I could not think with
any satisfaction of a so-called promotion which
must submerge his individuality in the measured
counsels and compromises of a number
of administrative colleagues. I prefer still to
think of him as Henry Labouchere, and not as
the Right Honorable Gentleman at the head
of this, that, or the other department of State.</p>

<h2>JOHN MORLEY</h2>

<p class="p2">No English public man of the present day
has had a more remarkable political career
than that of John Morley. Almost everything
that could be against success in political life
was against John Morley when he arose from
the student's desk to take his place on the
political platform. I am not now making any
allusion to the difficulties set in a man's way
by those accidents which the first Lord Lytton
described grandiloquently as the "twin gaolers
of the human heart, low birth and iron fortune."
I am not quite certain what iron fortune may
be, but if I assume it to be early poverty I do
not regard it as a very formidable obstruction
to human genius in our times. We have many
successful men in public life just now who
were born in humble station and had to struggle
hard for a long time against poverty. John
Morley was not born in humble life, as the
phrase goes, and had not, so far as I know, to
struggle against early poverty. He had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Oxford University education and was called
to the bar, but did not make any effort after
success in that profession. The difficulties to
which I have alluded as standing in his way
when he determined to seek a career in political
and Parliamentary life had nothing to do
with birth and with poverty&mdash;they were of
quite a different order.</p>

<p>Morley had taken to literature as a profession,
and had made for himself a distinguished
name as a writer of books and an editor of
reviews and newspapers before he obtained a
seat in the House of Commons. Now, there
is, or used to be, a sort of fixed belief in the
British public mind that a literary man is not,
in the nature of things, qualified for success in
Parliamentary work. We are somewhat getting
over this idea of late, and indeed there were
at all times living evidences enough to shake
such a faith. The generation which recognized
the success won in Parliamentary debate
by a Macaulay, a Disraeli, and a Bulwer-Lytton
might well have got over the notion that literary
men cannot succeed in Parliament; but
even up to the time of John Morley's election
to the House of Commons the idea found still
a very general acceptation. Another and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
more serious difficulty in John Morley's way
was the fact that he was a proclaimed agnostic
in questions of religious faith. Now, the average
Englishman can hardly be described as
one imbued with profound and exalted religious
convictions, but it may be taken for granted
that he thinks every respectable person who is
fit to be a member of Parliament ought to conform
to some recognized creed and to attend
some authorized place of worship. John Morley
was at one time not merely an agnostic, but
an avowed and somewhat aggressive agnostic,
and his brilliant pen had often been employed
to deal satirically with some established doctrine.</p>

<p>In England there is little or no general objection
to freedom of opinion so long as it is
a question merely of opinion. We may know
that a man holds free-thinking opinions, but we
feel no wish to inflict any manner of punishment
or deprivation on him so long as he keeps
his opinions to himself and does not endeavor
to make them prevail with others. This, however,
was what John Morley had got into the
way of doing. When he felt a strong conviction
on any subject which seemed to him
important, he always endeavored to justify his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
faith by argument and to bring others round
to his views of the question.</p>

<p>I can well remember that many of Morley's
admirers and friends were but little gratified
when it was first made known that he intended
to seek for a seat in the House of Commons.
Their impression was that he was just then
doing in effective and admirable style the very
kind of work for which he was best qualified,
and that it was a pity he should run the risk of
marring such a career for the sake of entering
a political field in which he might possibly win
no success, and in which success, even if won,
would be poor compensation for the sacrifice
of better work. Morley, however, seems to
have made up his mind, even at an early period
of his career, that he would try his chance in
Parliament. So long ago as 1865 he became a
candidate for a constituency in the North of
England, but was not successful; and in 1880,
after he had won genuine celebrity by his
biography of Edmund Burke, that of Voltaire,
that of Rousseau, and other books of the same
order, he became a candidate for the great
metropolitan division of Westminster. Here
again he was unsuccessful, and it was only in
1883 that he first obtained a seat in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of Commons as the representative of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
I can well remember listening with
the deepest interest to his maiden speech in
the House of Commons. The general impression
of the House was that the speech would
prove a failure, for only too many members had
already made up their minds, according to the
usual fashion of the day, that a successful literary
man was not likely to become a Parliamentary
success. There was a common impression
also that, despite his great gifts as a writer and
his proved capacity as a journalist and editor,
John Morley must be an impracticable sort of
person. He had been at one time well known
as an associate of the famous Positivist order
of thinkers&mdash;the order to which men like
Frederic Harrison and Richard Congreve belonged.
The average member of Parliament
could see no chance for a disciple of that
school, which this average member regarded
merely as a group of dreamers, to make any
mark in a practical assembly where the routine
business of legislation had to be carried on.
Morley's speech was, however, a distinct and
unmistakable success.</p>

<p>What first impressed the House of Commons
was the ready, quiet force of Morley's delivery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
He had a fine, clear voice, he spoke without
notes and without any manifest evidence of
preparation, every sentence expressed without
effort the precise meaning which he wished to
convey, and his style had an eloquence peculiarly
its own. What most men expected of
him was the philosophical discourse of a student
and a thinker no longer in his fitting place, and
what was least expected of him was just that
which he delivered, a ready, telling, and powerful
Parliamentary speech. He had some unexpected
difficulties to encounter, because he
gave out his opinions so forcibly and so boldly
that their utterance called forth frequent interruptions&mdash;an
unusual event in the case of a
maiden speech, which is generally regarded as
a mere introductory ceremonial and is taken
politely as a necessary matter of form. The
House soon found, however, that John Morley's
speech did not by any means belong to the
ordinary category of maiden performances, and
the very interruptions were therefore a positive
tribute to the importance of the new member's
argument. The interruptions were in every
sense fortunate for Morley, because they enabled
him at this very first opportunity to prove
his ready capacity for debate. He replied on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the spur of the moment to every interruption
and every interjected question, and he showed
all the composure, all the promptitude and the
command, of a practiced Parliamentary debater.
Every man in the House whose opinion
was worth having at once recognized the fact
that a new force had come up in Parliamentary
debate, and when John Morley resumed his
seat he must have known that he had accomplished
a complete success. From that time
onward John Morley has always been recognized
as one of the most powerful speakers in
the House of Commons. His voice is clear,
resonant, and musical, the light of intellect
gleams in his earnest eyes, his argument is
always well sustained and set off with varied
and appropriate illustration, and whenever he
rises to speak he is sure to have a deeply attentive
audience.</p>

<p>Morley is not in the highest sense one of the
orators of Parliament. He is not to be classed,
and has never sought to be classed, with such
men as Gladstone and Bright. But, short of
the highest gift of eloquence, he has every
quality needed to make a great Parliamentary
debater. When he addresses the House of
Commons, one ceases to think of him merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
as the scholar and the author, and he becomes
the man who can command the House by
the arguments and the eloquence which the
House best understands. There are many men
of high intellectual capacity who occasionally
take part in a Parliamentary debate and who
are always regarded as in the House but not
of it. John Morley proved from his very first
effort that he was of the House as well as in it.
I have heard him make great platform speeches,
and I think he comes nearer to the highest
order of eloquence when addressing an ordinary
political meeting than even when addressing the
House, but it is quite certain that at the present
time the House of Commons has no member
who can more completely command its attention.
It must be said, too, that the character of
the man himself, his transparent sincerity, his
absolute devotedness to principle, his fearless
and unselfish consistency, count for much in
the commanding position which he has obtained.
The integrity of Morley's career is absolutely
beyond criticism or cavil. It never entered
into the mind of his bitterest opponent to suspect
for a moment that Morley could be influenced
by any personal consideration in the
course which he took or the words which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
uttered. Other men of high position in Parliament
are commonly set down as having taken
this or that course, modified or suppressed this
or that opinion, for the sake of personal advancement,
or at least for the sake of maintaining
the interests of a party. But everybody
knows that John Morley has never sought for
office, and could never be induced to make any
compromise of political principle even for the
sake of maintaining in power the political party
to which he belongs. The universal recognition
of that great quality in him has added
unspeakably to his influence in Parliament.
He was not at any time a frequent speaker in
the House of Commons, and of course he never
was a mere talker. He speaks only when he
has something to say which he believes ought
to be said and to be said by him, and he never
seems to have any temptation to enter into
debate for the mere pleasure of taking part in
the controversy. If a man is really a good
speaker, the House is always ready to listen to
him no matter how often he may speak, for the
plain reason that debate has to go on for a certain
number of hours each day, and it is more
pleasant to listen to a member who talks well
than to one who talks badly. But, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
how effective and eloquent a speaker may be,
it is quite certain that the House will give him
a more attentive ear if it knows beforehand
that whenever he rises to take part in debate
it is sure to hear something which up to that
moment has not been spoken. John Morley,
therefore, very soon became one of that small
body of men in the House of Commons whose
rising to speak is always regarded as an event
of interest and importance.</p>

<p>In the retrospect of John Morley's career one
is brought up with something approaching to
a shock of surprise when he remembers that at
the opening of Morley's Parliamentary life he
was closely associated with Joseph Chamberlain.
I remember having heard people say at
the time that Chamberlain took much credit to
himself on the ground that he had urged and
prevailed upon John Morley to persevere in
seeking a seat in the House of Commons. Mr.
Chamberlain was at that time an extreme and
uncompromising Radical. He was an avowed
and constant supporter of the Home Rule
party; was in close alliance with Parnell; took
a leading part in the arrangement of the
so-called Kilmainham Treaty, and delivered
a warm panegyric on Parnell himself and Par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>nell's
policy to a crowded and for the most
part an indignant House of Commons. There
was, therefore, nothing surprising in the fact
that Morley and Chamberlain were at that
time friends and allies in political affairs, nor
had any one then the faintest reason to believe
that Chamberlain was ever destined to
undergo a sudden and miraculous conversion
to ultra-Tory principles. When Mr. Gladstone
came into office in 1886 with what was known
to be a Home Rule administration, John Morley
obtained the position of Chief Secretary to
the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, with a seat in
the Cabinet. It is not by any means a matter
of course that the Irish Chief Secretary should
be a Cabinet Minister. Sometimes the Lord-Lieutenant
himself has a place in the Cabinet
and the Chief Secretary is merely an ordinary
member of the Government; sometimes,
when the Chief Secretary is regarded as a
very strong man, he is invited to a seat in the
Cabinet and his official master remains outside.
John Morley was recognized from the
first by Gladstone as a man of the highest
political capacity and character, and when the
new administration came to be formed Gladstone
made evident this estimate of Morley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by offering him a place in the Cabinet. The
keenest interest was felt alike both by political
friends and political enemies in Morley's
management of Irish affairs. The new Secretary
for Ireland was entering bravely on an
enterprise the immediate success of which was,
under the conditions, absolutely impossible. I
have no doubt whatever that success could
have been easily and completely accomplished
if John Morley had been allowed his own way
in dealing with the whole Irish question&mdash;if,
for instance, he had been placed in such
a position of dictatorship as that which was
given to Lord Durham when Durham was
sent out to deal with the rebellion in Canada.
Durham saw but one remedy for the
long discontents and troubles of the Canadian
populations, and that remedy he found in the
system of Home Rule which has since made
Canada peaceful, prosperous, and well content
with the place she holds in the British Empire.
If John Morley could have been invested
with such powers as those given to Lord
Durham, he might have made of Ireland
another prosperous and contented Canada.
But Morley had to administer the affairs of
Ireland at a time when the opinion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
English majority had not yet risen to the principle
of Home Rule, at least so far as Ireland
was concerned, and without such recognition
it was beyond the reach of statesmanship to
satisfy the national demands of the Irish people.
Every Irish Nationalist knew perfectly
well that John Morley's heart and intellect
alike were with the cause of Irish Home Rule.
All that Morley could do to mitigate the troubles
of the country and the people he did
bravely and steadfastly. Ireland was then the
victim of an accumulation of coercion laws
which made almost every popular movement,
every attempt to maintain an oppressed tenant
against an oppressive landlord, every protest
against despotic legislation, liable to be treated
as an offense calling for the interference of
the police. John Morley did all that could be
done to mitigate the rigors of such a system,
and to administer Ireland on something like
the principles of civilization and freedom. He
had in this task the full support, encouragement,
and sympathy of the statesman who was
then Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland&mdash;the Earl
of Aberdeen, a man of the most thoroughly
Liberal principles and a sincere friend to Ireland.
But, of course, neither Lord Aberdeen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
nor John Morley could abolish at a word of
command a whole system of penal legislation,
and all that could be done was to take care
that the laws should be administered in a
temperate and reasonable spirit, and that the
rulers of Ireland should show themselves to be
at heart the friends of Ireland.</p>

<p>There comes back to my memory a somewhat
curious illustration of the difficulties
which then stood in the way of any cordial
intercourse between the representatives of
English rule in Ireland and the representatives
of the Irish national cause, and I cannot
resist the temptation to tell the story here.
During Morley's first term of office as Chief
Secretary I made some visits to Dublin. I
had many meetings with Morley, of course,
and he invited me to dine with him at the
Chief Secretary's Lodge in Phoenix Park.
Now, there had been during all my time a
rigorous rule among Irish Nationalists not to
accept any of the hospitalities of those who
exercised imperial authority in Dublin. No
true Nationalist would make one at any social
gathering in the official residence of the Viceroy
or the Chief Secretary. There were more
than merely sentimental reasons for such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
principle. In former days the Irish people
had in several well-remembered instances seen
some vehement advocate of the Irish National
cause won over by the promises and the blandishments
of Dublin Castle to take office under
the Government and to renounce the political
faith the profession of which had won for him
his seat in Parliament. Therefore it was above
all things necessary, in order to maintain the
confidence of the Irish people, that the national
representatives should show themselves determined
not to be drawn into any familiar social
relations with the representatives of English
rule in Ireland. This was especially a part of
Parnell's policy, and on it Parnell laid much
stress. John Morley came over to Ireland in
a spirit of full friendship towards the Irish
people, and he had every reason to believe
that the Irish people thoroughly understood
his feelings and his hopes. He and I had
known each other during many years in London,
and when we met in Dublin, he, being
still new to the conditions of the place, invited
me to dine with him. I explained to him that,
however delighted I should be to dine with
my friend John Morley, it was quite impossible
that I should dine with the Chief Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
at his official residence in Dublin. I assured
him that if I were to accept such an invitation
the Tory papers of Dublin would be certain
to make characteristic comments on the fact
that the Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant
and the Vice-Chairman of the Irish Parliamentary
party had been dining together in
the Chief Secretary's official home, and that
we should both alike find ourselves the objects
of something approaching to a public scandal.
Morley was surprised at first and then a good
deal amused, but he accepted my explanation,
and thoroughly understood that it was not any
want of friendly feeling which led me to decline
his invitation. So we parted as good friends
as ever. We still met frequently and talked
over questions relating to Irish administration.
One day Morley came to see me at the Shelburne
Hotel, which was then my home in Dublin.
We had a long talk, and, as the hour was
growing late, I asked him to stay and dine
with me, not remembering at the time that the
eye of the public was supposed to be on our
movements. One of Morley's happiest gifts is
a delightful sense of humor. He rose to the
situation at once. Addressing me in solemn
tones, but with a gleam of the comic in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
eyes, he informed me that if my principles did
not allow me to dine with the Chief Secretary
in Dublin, so neither did the Chief Secretary's
principles allow him to dine there with me.
Thus, as some newspaper writers would say,
the incident terminated, and we made no further
effort at convivial meetings in Dublin.</p>

<p>John Morley's quick sense of humor is not
one of the qualities which a stranger would
naturally look for in him. Those who have
not met him and have known him only through
his writings are apt to think of him as a grave
and even an austere man, a man wholly immersed
in the serious contemplation of life and
history, and, if endowed with any sense of humor,
only with a sense of its more grim and
saturnine aspects. The man himself is altogether
and curiously unlike the impression thus
formed of him very commonly by those to whom
he is not personally known. John Morley has
a quick, keen, and delightful sense of humor.
He can talk on any subject from grave to gay,
from lively to severe. He is one of the most
charming of companions, and he is a great favorite
among women, even among those who do
not greatly concern themselves with the question
of woman's political emancipation. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
is nothing of the stern philosopher about his
manner of comporting himself in social life.
Indeed, for all the clear composure of his philosophic
contemplations, he has a temperament
far too quick and sensitive to allow of his meeting
all life's vexatious questions in the mood of
stoical endurance. He is by nature somewhat
nervous, is decidedly quick in temper, frankly
acknowledges that he is rather impatient of
contradiction, and is likely to become overheated
in the course of an eager argument. I
feel the less hesitation in noticing these little
peculiarities on the part of my friend because I
have heard Morley himself speak of them with
perfect frankness as some of his troubles in
political controversy. I must say that, so far
as I know, these unphilosophical qualities of
Morley's temperament only tend to make him
all the more a charming friend to his friends.
We may admire the marble-like composure of
the stern philosopher who yields to no passing
human weaknesses of temper, but it must be
very hard to keep always on friendly terms with
so superhuman a personage.</p>

<p>Mr. Morley goes into society a good deal in
London, is often to be seen at the theaters on
first nights, seems to enjoy a dinner party or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
an evening party as well as the most commonplace
among us might do, but I do not believe
that he has any liking for great shows and
pompous celebrations and the other formal demonstrations
of Court festivity and Ministerial
display. In his quiet London home he leads
the life of a man of culture, a scholar and a
writer, so far as his political and Parliamentary
engagements allow him leisure for such recreation,
and he neither seeks the madding crowd
nor shuns it. It has always been a wonder to
me how such a man can find time for his many
and diverse studies and occupations, and should
never either neglect the work of his life or shut
himself away from its reasonable enjoyments.
John Morley is indeed a rare and almost unique
combination of the philosophical thinker, the
vivid biographer, the Parliamentary debater,
and the practical administrator. His life of
Richard Cobden is one of the most complete
and characteristic pieces of biography accomplished
during our time. There would not
seem to have been much that was congenial
between the temperament of Richard Cobden
and that of John Morley. Cobden was not a
laborious student of the past; he had no widespread
and varied literary or artistic sympa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>thies;
he did not concern himself much with
any scientific studies except those which have
to do with the actual movements of man's working
lifetime; he was a great practical reformer,
not a scholar, a philosopher, or even a devoted
lover of books. I do not know that John Morley
was personally well acquainted with Cobden,
and I am rather inclined to believe that in
his biography of the great free-trader he relied
mainly on Cobden's correspondence and on the
information given to him by members of Cobden's
family. Yet he has created a perfect living
picture of Cobden as Cobden's friends all
knew him, and he has shown to coming generations,
not merely what Cobden said and did,
what great reforms he accomplished, and what
further reforms he ever had in view, but he has
shown what Cobden actually was, and made the
man himself a familiar figure to all who read
the book. So far as I can judge, he has
achieved the same success when telling us of
Burke, of Voltaire, and of Rousseau, and has
made us feel that with his guidance we come
to know the men themselves as well as the
parts they performed in politics or in literature.</p>

<p>Morley has for a long time been engaged in
preparing his life of Gladstone, and the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of England, which has lately been distracted
by the vicissitudes of war, is now free to turn
to quieter thoughts, and to look with eager expectation
for the completion of the book. No
other living man could have anything like John
Morley's qualifications as the biographer of
Gladstone. He is one of the greatest masters
of lucid and vigorous English prose. He has
been what I may call a professional student of
the lives of great men; he is a profound political
thinker; and he has the faculty of describing
to the life and making his subject live
again. In addition to all these claims to the
position of Gladstone's authorized biographer
comes the fact that Morley was for many years
intrusted with Gladstone's fullest confidence.
To no one did Gladstone make his feelings and
his purposes on all political questions more
fully known than to John Morley; and I think
I am justified in saying that at more than one
critical period in his later political history Gladstone
chose Morley as his especial and, for the
time, his only confidant. I can say of my own
knowledge that in the later years of Gladstone's
active political life there were momentous occasions
when John Morley acted as the one sole
medium of private communication between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Gladstone and the leaders of the Irish party.
I know, too, how careful and methodical Morley
showed himself on all such occasions, and
with what ample and accurate notes he preserved
the exact record of every day's intercommunications.
This is, indeed, one of
Morley's characteristic peculiarities&mdash;the combination
of exalted thought with the most minute
attention to the very routine of practical work.
That combination of qualities will display itself,
I feel quite certain, with complete success in
Morley's history of Gladstone's life. John Morley
has still, we may well hope, a long political
career before him. When the Liberal party
next comes into power, John Morley will unquestionably
have one of its most commanding
offices placed at his disposal. Meanwhile he
has ample work on hand even for his energy
and perseverance. He is just finishing his life
of Gladstone, and is to take charge of the magnificent
library which belonged to the late Lord
Acton, the greatest English scholar and book-lover
of our time. Mr. Carnegie's gift of this
great library, lately bought by him, to John
Morley, is an act which does honor to the intellect
as well as to the heart of the generous
donor. Whatever positions, honors, or respon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>sibilities
maybe yet before John Morley, it may
be taken for granted that he has already won
for himself a secure place in the literature and
the political life of his country, and that his
name will live in its history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE EARL OF ABERDEEN</h2>

<p class="p2">The Earl of Aberdeen will always be associated
in my mind with a most hopeful season
of our political life, a season none the less
cherished in memory and none the less auspicious
because its hopes were doomed to temporary
disappointment. That bright season was
the time when Mr. Gladstone was endeavoring
to carry out his policy of Home Rule for Ireland.
I need hardly tell my American readers
that Gladstone's policy was condemned to failure,
partly because of a secession of Liberals
who went over to the Conservative ranks for
the purpose of opposing the measure, and then
because of the attitude taken by the House of
Lords, who, thus encouraged, rejected the bill
after it had passed the House of Commons.
The season, therefore, which I am now recalling
to memory was that which came between Mr.
Gladstone's promulgation of his Home Rule
policy and the rejection of his second measure
of Home Rule. The interval was one full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the brightest hopes for all true British Liberals
and all Irish Nationalists. For the first time
during my recollection, British Liberalism and
Irish Nationalism were in true companionship
and concord. We fraternized as English and
Irish politicians had probably never fraternized
before. On both sides we were filled with the
fond belief that the disunion of Great Britain
and Ireland was soon to come to an end, and
that the true and lasting union of the two
peoples would be accomplished by Gladstone's
policy of giving to Ireland her national self-government.
It was a season of much festivity
in London, and the Irish Nationalist members
of Parliament were welcome guests in all the
great Liberals' houses. No figures are more
thoroughly associated in my memory with that
time than those of Lord Aberdeen and his
gifted and noble-minded wife.</p>

<p>Lord Aberdeen is the grandson of that Earl
of Aberdeen whose coalition ministry, a luckless
effort at a temporary compromise between
hostile political forces, came to a disastrous end
during the Crimean War. The present Earl
succeeded to the title in 1870. He was educated
at the University of St. Andrews, in
Scotland, and afterwards at University College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Oxford. Lord Aberdeen was a Conservative
in his political principles when he entered the
House of Lords. But he had too much intellect
and too much independence of mind to remain
long in subserviency to the traditional creed of
a mere party. He differed from his leaders on
several important questions before he had fully
seen his way to take up his position as a
recognized member of the Liberal organization.
Most of us who had followed his career
thus far with any attention felt sure that the
Conservatives would not long be able to keep
such a man among their slow-going and unenlightened
ranks, and no surprise was felt on
either side when he took his natural place as
a follower of Mr. Gladstone. Lord Aberdeen
became an earnest advocate of the Home Rule
policy, and all the noble influence that he
and his wife could bring to bear publicly and
privately was exerted in support of the cause.
Then it was that I first came to know Lord
and Lady Aberdeen. I have before me just
now a book called "Notables of Britain," described
on its title-page as "An Album of
Portraits and Autographs of the Most Eminent
Subjects of Her Majesty in the Sixtieth Year
of Her Reign." This book was published at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the office of the "Review of Reviews," and was
understood to be the production of Mr. W. T.
Stead. It contains an excellent full-length
photograph of Lord Aberdeen, who, I may say,
has a face and figure well worthy to be preserved
by painter and photographer for the
benefit of those who in coming days are interested
in the notables of Britain. The portrait,
like all the other portraits in the volume, is
accompanied by an autograph line or two.
Lord Aberdeen's written words seem to me
peculiarly characteristic of the writer's bright
and hopeful spirit. I quote his words&mdash;the
writing is clear and well formed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">I think this is a good motto:</div>
    <div class="line indent2">"<i>Transeunt nubes&mdash;manet cælum</i>."</div>
  </div>
  <div class="sigmiddle"><span class="smcap">Aberdeen.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The temper in which Lord Aberdeen conducted
all his political intercourse during this
period of promise was one of unchanging courage
and hopefulness. He was one of the most
active and ready among the supporters of Mr.
Gladstone, and he found an untiring and invaluable
companion in his charming wife. At that
time we used to hold political gatherings in
private houses as well as in public halls, and I
have taken part in more than one Home Rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
demonstration held in the private dwellings of
some of Mr. Gladstone's colleagues in office.
We used to have many social meetings for the
purpose of bringing Englishmen and Irishmen
into close association. Even Parnell himself
was prevailed upon to abandon for the time his
rule of seclusion from society, and to meet Mr.
Gladstone and Lord Spencer and other leading
Englishmen at private dinner parties. Lord
Aberdeen was one of the most conspicuous
and one of the most attractive figures in these
political and social gatherings, and I could not,
indeed, recall that period to memory for a moment
without finding his figure photographed
prominently in it. It was an interesting sight
during all that time to see some of the most
extreme and most aggressive members of the
Irish Parliamentary party mingling in social life
with British peers and magnates who only a
few years before would probably have regarded
those Irish members as traitors to the Queen
and fitting inmates of the prison cell. On the
other hand, too, it must be said that only a very
few years before the Irish Nationalist member
who was known to make his appearance in the
London drawing-rooms of English aristocracy
would have been set down by the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
his countrymen as a flunkey in spirit and a
traitor to his cause. There was a time not
long before when an Irish Nationalist member
would have needed some courage to enable
him to meet his constituents on election day
if the local papers had made it known that
he was in the habit of showing himself in
the drawing-rooms of English peers. All this
sudden and complete change had been brought
about by the genius and policy of Gladstone
when he came to see the true meaning and the
true claims of the demand for Irish Home
Rule. My memory goes back with a somewhat
melancholy pleasure to those days of
hope and confidence when the true union of
Great Britain and Ireland seemed actually on
the verge of consummation. Nor have I the
slightest doubt that the lessons taught during
that season will have their full influence once
again when the period of reaction is over, and
that Gladstone's policy of 1886 will come to life
again before very long and will accomplish its
work once for all.</p>

<p>In that year, 1886, Gladstone appointed Lord
Aberdeen to the office of Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland. The position was given to Lord Aberdeen
with the frankly proclaimed purpose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he was to be the Lord-Lieutenant of a Home
Rule policy, and, indeed, on no other conditions
would Lord Aberdeen have consented to
accept the office. Lord Aberdeen's short term
of rule in Ireland was a complete success.
There was not much that the most Liberal
Lord-Lieutenant could do in the way of positive
administration for the benefit of the island.
There was already in existence a whole code of
repressive legislation compiled during successive
ages of despotic government, and this existing
code it was not in the power of Lord Aberdeen
or any other Viceroy to abolish or even to
modify. All that the new Lord-Lieutenant
could do in the way of political relief to the
Irish people was to discourage as much as
possible the too frequent application of the
coercive laws and to make it known that the
sympathies of the new Government were in
favor of political freedom for Ireland, as well
as for England and Scotland. Lord Aberdeen
fulfilled this part of his public duty with a
brave heart and with all the success possible to
the task. Every one who had any acquaintance
with the state of Ireland at the time must have
known what difficulties were likely to be set in
the way of Lord Aberdeen's endeavor to miti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>gate
the severities of the coercion system. The
most serious of those difficulties would in all
probability have come from the permanent official
staff in Dublin Castle. American readers
in general can have but little idea as to the
peculiarities of that singular institution Dublin
Castle, the center and fortress of Irish government.
It has become, from generations of
usage, a very bulwark against the progress of
Irish national sentiment. The fresh current
of feeling from the outside seems to make little
impression on its stagnant and moldy atmosphere.
It is ruled by tradition, and to that
tradition belongs the rule of hostility to every
popular feeling and every national demand.
Lord Aberdeen had to encounter all the resistance
which the dead weight of Dublin Castle's
antiquated systems could bring to bear against
his liberal and enlightened efforts at the pacification
of the country. He carried out his
purpose with unflinching resolve and unruffled
temper, and, so far as the existing laws allowed
him, he mitigated the harshnesses of the system
under which Ireland had been governed since
the Act of Union. But there was, of course,
much more within Lord Aberdeen's capacity to
accomplish than the mere mitigation of exist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>ing
laws which it was not in his power to
abolish. His presence and the entire conduct
of his viceroyalty were as a proclamation to the
Irish people that the whole sympathies of the
Gladstone Government went with the national
demands.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, a strange sight was to be seen
in Dublin&mdash;the sight of a thoroughly popular
welcome, a national welcome, given to the representative
of English rule in Ireland. A new
chapter in Irish history seemed to open, and
the heart of Ireland was filled with hope. It
is told of Swift that when Carteret, Earl Granville,
was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland&mdash;Swift
afterwards became one of Granville's
close friends&mdash;he exclaimed in his sarcastic
fashion that he could not understand why such
a man should be appointed to such an office,
and he thought the Government ought to keep
on sending its bullies and blockheads just as
before. A satirical Nationalist might have been
expected to break forth into a similar expression
of wonder when a man like Lord Aberdeen
was sent to Ireland to carry on the rule
of Dublin Castle. Lord Aberdeen and his wife
made themselves popular everywhere among
the Irish people, showed a living and a con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>stant
interest in everything that concerned the
welfare of the population, and did all they could
to break down the long-existing barricades
which made England and Ireland hostile nations.
When Mr. Gladstone failed in carrying
his Home Rule Bill through the House of Commons
and his Government came to an end, Lord
Aberdeen took his leave of Ireland amid demonstrations
of popular regard, affection, and regret
which must have deeply touched his generous
heart. In 1893, when the Liberals were again
in power, Lord Aberdeen was made Governor-General
of Canada, and he held that position
until 1898. His term of service in Canada
was as successful as might have been expected,
and the French as well as the other provinces
looked up to him with admiration and gratitude.
Then, for the time, his official career
came to an end. In the interval between the
Irish and the Canadian appointment Lord Aberdeen
and his wife made a tour round the world,
visiting on their way India and most of the
British colonies. The name of Lady Aberdeen
is associated with all great movements which
have to do with the education and the general
advancement of women, and with many good
works undertaken for the benefit of the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
peasantry. Lady Aberdeen, it should be said,
is the youngest daughter of the first Lord
Tweedmouth, and is sister of the Lord Tweedmouth
who, as Edward Marjoribanks, was so
well known for a long time as one of the leading
Whips of the Liberal party. Lady Aberdeen's
name is Ishbel Maria, and I may ask my
American readers not to make the mistake,
sometimes made even in England, of assuming
her name to be the more familiar one of Isabel.
She has always been one of the most prominent,
influential, and graceful figures in English
society, and every charitable association
which deserves her support has the advantage
of her help, her protection, and her guidance.
I know from my own experience what valuable
and untiring service she has given to the
promotion of the lace-making and the cottage
industries of Ireland. I had the great honor
of being associated with her in some of these
efforts, and I never can forget her unsparing
devotion to the best interests of every such
effort. I have among my books a series of
large and handsome volumes devoted to a record
of the proceedings which took place at the
International Council of Women held in London
during July of 1899 and presided over by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Countess of Aberdeen. This series, published
by Mr. Fisher Unwin, is edited by Lady
Aberdeen and has an introduction written by
her. I may quote the closing paragraph of the
introduction:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is a great inspiration to be bound together in the
pursuance of high ideals; it is also a grave responsibility&mdash;and
during our recent Council meeting both these
thoughts have been made very real to us. I pray God
that they may abide within the hearts of all who, in every
country, are the guardians of the honor of our Council, so
that it may prove true to the lofty profession it has made.</p></blockquote>

<p>The series contains seven volumes, every one
of which has been carefully edited by Lady
Aberdeen, and is enriched with many commentaries
of her own. One can easily imagine the
amount of time and trouble which such a work
must have imposed on a busy woman, and
those who know anything of her will know the
thought and care and devotion which she must
have given to such a labor of love.</p>

<p>Not a few persons are still apt to associate
the idea of a woman advocating the advancement
of women with something unfeminine,
ungracious, self-assertive, and overbearing.
When Lady Aberdeen first began to be known
in social movements, the memory of the late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Mrs. Lynn Linton's diatribes about "the Shrieking
Sisterhood" was still fresh in the public
mind, and much prejudice yet lingered against
the women who publicly devoted themselves
to the advancement of their sex. Lady Aberdeen
might have seemed as if she were specially
created to be a living refutation of all such
absurd ideas. No fashionable woman given up
to social success and distinction in drawing-rooms,
dining-rooms, balls, and Court ceremonials
could have been more feminine, graceful,
and charming in her ways and her demeanor
than this noble-hearted woman, who was not
afraid to advocate the genuine rights of women,
and who stood by her husband's side in all his
efforts for political reform. One might adopt
the words which Sheridan has made the opening
of a song in "The Duenna," and proclaim
that a pair was never seen more justly formed
to meet by nature than Lord and Lady Aberdeen.
Such an impression was assuredly formed
in Ireland and in Canada, and indeed in every
place where Lord and Lady Aberdeen were
able to assert their unostentatious and most
beneficent influence.</p>

<p>Lord Aberdeen succeeded to the title and its
responsibilities at too early an age to allow him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
any opportunity of proving his capacity for Parliamentary
life in the House of Commons. His
elder brother was drowned on a voyage from
Boston to Melbourne, and the subject of this
article then became Earl of Aberdeen, with, as
a matter of course, a seat in the House of
Lords. There is nothing like a real Parliamentary
career to be found in the House of Lords.
A man of great natural gifts can, of course,
give evidence even there that he is born for
statesmanship and can command attention by
his eloquence. Lord Aberdeen made it certain
even in the House of Lords that he was
endowed with these rare qualifications. But
the House of Lords has no influence over the
country, unless, indeed, when it exerts itself to
stay for the time the progress of some great and
popular measure. Even this is only for the
time, and if the measure be really one of national
benefit and deserving of public support,
it is sure to be carried in the end, and the
Lords have to give in and to put up with their
defeat. But the hereditary chamber is not even
a commanding platform from which an eloquent
speaker can address and can influence
the whole country, and the temptations there
to apathy and indolence must often be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to be almost irresistible. On rare occasions,
two or three times in a session, perhaps, there
comes off what is popularly called a full-dress
debate, and then the red benches of the House,
on which the peers have their seats, are sure
to be crowded, and the galleries where members
of the House of Commons are entitled to
sit and the galleries allotted to strangers are
also well occupied. The Lords have even the
inspiriting advantage, denied to the House of
Commons, of open galleries where ladies can
sit in the full glare of day or of gaslight, and
can encourage an orator by their presence and
their attention. In the House of Commons, as
everybody knows, the small number of ladies
for whom seats are provided are secreted behind
a thick grating, and thus become an almost
invisible influence, if, indeed, they can hope to
be an influence at all. Yet even this inspiration
does not stir the peers to anything more
than the rarest attempts at a great debate. On
ordinary occasions&mdash;and these ordinary occasions
constitute nearly the whole of a session&mdash;the
peers sit for only an hour or so every
day, and then mutter and mumble through
some formal business, and the outer public
does not manifest the slightest interest in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
they are doing or trying to do. There are
many men now in the House of Lords who
proved their eloquence again and again during
some of the most important and exciting debates
in the representative chamber, and who
now hardly open their lips in the gilded chamber,
as the House of Lords has been grandiloquently
titled. A rising member of the House
of Commons succeeds to the family title and
estates, and as a matter of course he is transferred
to the House of Lords, and there, in
most cases, is an end to his public career. Or
perhaps a rising member of the House of Commons
has in some way or other made himself
inconvenient to his leading colleagues who
have now come into power and are forming
an administration, and as they do not know
how to get rid of him gracefully in any other
way, they induce the Sovereign to confer on
him a peerage, and so he straightway goes
into the House of Lords. Perhaps, as he had
been an active and conspicuous debater in the
House of Commons, he cannot bring himself
to settle down into silence when he finds himself
among the peers. So he delivers a speech
every now and then on what are conventionally
regarded in the House of Lords as great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
occasions, but his career is practically at an
end all the same. I have in my mind some
striking instances of this curious transition
from Parliamentary prominence in the House
of Commons to Parliamentary nothingness in
the House of Lords. I know of men who
were accounted powerful and brilliant debaters
in the House of Commons, where debates are
sometimes great events, who, when, from one
cause or other, translated to the House of
Lords, were hardly ever heard of as debaters
any more. Probably there seemed no motive
for taking the trouble to seek the opportunity
of delivering a speech in the hereditary assembly,
where nothing particular could come of
the speech when delivered, and the new peer
allows the charms of public speaking to lose
their hold over him, to pass with the days and
the dreams of his youth.</p>

<p>Lord Aberdeen would in all probability have
made a deep mark as a Parliamentary debater
if the kindly fates had left to him the possibility
of a career in the House of Commons.
He has a fine voice, an attractive presence,
and a fluent delivery; he has high intellectual
capacity, wide and varied culture, and much
acquaintance with foreign States and peoples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Probably the best services which Lord Aberdeen
could render to his country would be
found in such offices as Ireland and Canada
gave him an opportunity of undertaking; viceroyalty
of some order, it would seem, must be
the main business of his career. But I must
say that I should much like to see his great
intellectual qualities, his varied experience, and
his noble humanitarian sympathies provided
with some opportunity of exercising themselves
in the work of domestic government. I may
explain that I do not call the administration of
Ireland under the old conditions a work of
domestic government in the true sense. The
vice-regal system in Ireland is a barbaric anachronism,
and the abilities and high purposes
of a man like Lord Aberdeen were wholly
thrown away upon such work. There is much
still in the social condition of England which
could give ample occupation to the administrative
abilities and the philanthropic energies
of Lord Aberdeen. The work of decentralization
in England is rapidly going on. The
development of local self-government is becoming
one of the most remarkable phenomena
of our times. Parliament is becoming
more and more the fount and origin of na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>tional
rule, but it is wisely devoting its energies
to the creation of a system which shall leave
the working out of that national rule more and
more to localities and municipalities. At one
time, and that not very long ago, it was believed
even by many social reformers that, while
self-government might easily be developed in
the cities and towns, it would not be possible,
during the present generation at least, to infuse
any such principle of vitality into the country
districts.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, it is becoming more
and more apparent that the principle of local
government is developing itself rapidly and
effectively in the rural districts, and that the
good old times when the squire and the rector
could manage by divided despotism the whole
business of a parish are destined soon to become
a curious historical memory. The system
of national education, established for the
first time in England by Gladstone's Government
in 1870, has naturally had much to do
with the quickening of intelligent activity all
over the British Islands. A new generation has
grown up, in which localities are no longer content
to have all their business managed for
them by their local magnates, and the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
statutes passed by Parliament for the extension
everywhere of the local government principle
are a direct result of the legislation which has
made education compulsory in these countries.
All over the agricultural districts we now find
county boards and parish councils conducting
by debates and divisions the common business
of each district, just as it is done in the great
cities and towns. It seems to me that this
spread of the principle of local self-government
opens a most appropriate field for the intellect
and the energies of such statesmen as Lord
Aberdeen. Only in recent times have great
noblemen condescended to trouble themselves
much, so far at least as their Parliamentary careers
were concerned, with municipal or other
local affairs. A peer, if he happened to have
any taste or gift for Parliamentary and official
work, was willing to become Foreign Secretary,
Viceroy of India, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
or Governor of a Colony. Not infrequently,
too, he consented to devote his energies to
the office of Postmaster-General. But he was
not likely to see any scope for a Parliamentary
career in the management of local business.
In his own particular district, no doubt, he was
accustomed to direct most of the business in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
his own way and might be a local benefactor
or a local mis-manager, according as his tastes
and judgment qualified him. But the general
business of localities did not create any Parliamentary
department which seemed likely to
deserve his attention. The condition of things
is very different now, and Lord Aberdeen is
one of the men to whom the country is mainly
indebted for that quickening and outspreading
of the local self-governing principle which is
so remarkable and so hopeful a phenomenon
of our national existence at present. In every
movement which pretends to the development
and the strengthening of that principle Lord
Aberdeen has always taken a foremost part.</p>

<p>I am not myself an unqualified admirer of
that part of the British constitutional system
which makes the House of Lords one of three
great ruling powers. I should very much doubt
whether Lord Aberdeen himself, if he were
set to devise a constitutional system for these
countries, would make the House of Lords as
at present arranged a component part of our
legislative system. But I am quite willing to
admit that, since we have a House of Lords
and while we have a House of Lords, a man
like the Earl of Aberdeen does all that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
done to turn the existing constitution to good
account and make it in some degree worthy
of national toleration. While there exists an
aristocracy of birth, even the most uncompromising
advocate of democracy and the equal
rights of men might freely admit that a career
like the political and social career of Lord
Aberdeen does much to plead in defense of
the system. Lord Aberdeen has always proved
that he thoroughly understands the responsibilities
as well as the advantages of his high
position. Not one of the Labor Members, as
they are called, of the House of Commons&mdash;the
chosen representatives of the working
classes&mdash;could have shown a deeper and more
constant sympathy with every measure and
every movement which tends to improve the
condition and expand the opportunities of
those who have to make a living by actual
toil. Lord Aberdeen has yet, I trust, a long
and fruitful career before him. The statesmanship
of England will soon again have to
turn its attention to the social movements
which concern the interests of the lowly-born
and the hard-working in these islands. If a
better time is coming for the statesmen of
England, whether in office or in opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
who love peace and who yearn to take a part
in measures which lead to genuine national
prosperity, we may safely assume that in such
a time Lord Aberdeen will renew his active
career, to the benefit of the people whom he
has served so faithfully and so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<h2>JOHN BURNS</h2>

<p class="p2">John Burns stands out a distinct and peculiar
figure in the House of Commons. He is
the foremost representative of that working
class which is becoming so great a power in
the organization of English political and industrial
life. "Be not like dumb driven cattle,"
says Longfellow in his often-quoted lines&mdash;"Be
a hero in the strife." The British workingmen
were until very lately little better than
dumb driven cattle; in our days and under
such leadership as that of John Burns they have
proved themselves capable of bearing heroic
part in the struggle for great reforms. I can
remember the time when the House of Commons
had not in it any member actually belonging
to the working classes. At that time the
working classes had no means of obtaining
Parliamentary representation, for it may be said
with almost literal exactness that no workingman
had a vote, or the means of obtaining a
vote, at a Parliamentary election. The condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>tions
of the franchise were too limited in the
constituencies to enable men who worked for
small daily or weekly wages to become voters
at elections. In order to become a voter a man
must occupy a house rated at a certain yearly
amount, and he must have occupied it for a
specified and considerable space of time, and
there were very few indeed of the working class
who could hope to obtain such legal qualifications.
In more recent days the great reformers
of these islands have succeeded in establishing
what may be fairly described as manhood suffrage
in these countries, and have also secured
a lodger franchise; have established the secret
ballot as the process of voting; and by these
and other reforms have put the workingman on
a level with his fellow-citizens as a voter at
Parliamentary elections. My own recollection
goes back to the time when the law in Great
Britain and Ireland insisted on what was called
a "property qualification" as an indispensable
condition to a candidate's obtaining a seat in
the House of Commons. I have known scores
of instances in which clever and popular candidates
got over this difficulty by prevailing on
some wealthy relative or friend to settle legally
on them an amount of landed property neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>sary
to qualify them for a seat in the House.
It was perfectly well known to every one that
this settlement was purely a formal arrangement,
and that the new and nominal possessor
of the property was no more its real owner
than the child who is allowed for a moment to
hold his father's watch in his hand becomes
thereby the legal owner of the valuable timepiece.
In our days no property qualification
of any kind is needed either for a vote at a
Parliamentary election or for a seat in the
House of Commons, and therefore the workingmen
form an important proportion of the
voters at Parliamentary elections and are enabled
in certain constituencies to choose men
of their own class to represent them in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>I have thought it well to make the short
explanation of the changes which have taken
place in the condition of the British workingmen
during recent years as a prelude to what
I have to say concerning that foremost of British
workingmen, John Burns. It is only fair
to say that the workingmen of these countries
have made judicious and praiseworthy use of
the new political powers confided to them, and
have almost invariably sent into Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
as the representatives of their class men of undoubted
ability and of the highest character,
men who win the respect of all parties in the
House of Commons. Of these men John
Burns is the most conspicuous. He has never,
indeed, held a place in an administration, as
two, I think, of his order have already done;
but then John Burns is a man of resolutely
independent character, and it would not be
easy thus far to form even a Liberal Government
which should be quite up to the level of
his views on many questions of domestic and
foreign policy.</p>

<p>John Burns would hardly be taken personally
as a typical representative of the British
workingman. He is short in stature, very dark
in complexion and in the color of his hair, and
a stranger seeing him for the first time might
take him for an Italian or a Spaniard. His
physical strength is something enormous, and
I have seen him perform with the greatest
apparent ease some feats of athletic vigor which
might have seemed to demand the proportions
of a giant. His whole frame is made up of
bone and muscle, and although he is broadly
and stoutly built, he does not appear to have
any superfluous flesh. If I had to make my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
way through a furious opposing crowd, I do
not know of any leader whom I should be more
glad to follow than John Burns. But although
Burns is physically made for a fighting man,
there is nothing pugnacious or aggressive in
his temperament. He is by nature kind, conciliatory,
and generous, tolerant of other men's
opinions, and only anxious to advance his own
by fair argument and manly appeals to men's
sense of humanity and justice. I have seen
him carry a great big elderly man who had
fainted at a public meeting and take him to a
quiet spot with all the ease and tenderness of
a mother carrying her child. But if I were an
overbearing giant who was trying his strength
upon a weaker mortal, I should take good care
not to make the experiment while John Burns
was anywhere within reach. He is an adept
at all sorts of athletic sports and games, skating,
rowing, foot-racing, boxing, cricket, and I
know not what else. He is essentially a man
of the working class, and has, I believe, some
Scottish blood in his veins, but he is a Londoner
by birth, and passed all his early life in a London
district. He was born to poverty, and
received such education as he had to begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
with at a humble school in the Battersea region
on the south side of London.</p>

<p>Now, I should think that a boy born in
humble life who had in him any gift of imagination
and any faculty for self-improvement
could hardly have begun life in a better place
than Battersea. The Battersea region lies south
of the Thames, and is a strange combination of
modern squalidness and picturesque historical
associations and memorials. The homes of the
working class poor stand under the very shadow
of that famous church in Old Battersea where
Bolingbroke, the high-born, one of the most
eloquent orators known to English Parliamentary
life, and one of the most brilliant writers
who adorn English literature, lies buried, and
where strangers from all parts of the world go
to gaze upon his tombstone. Everywhere
throughout the little town or village one comes
upon places associated with the memory of
Bolingbroke and of other men famous in history.
Cross the bridge that spans the Thames
and you are in the Chelsea region, which is
suffused with historical and literary associations
from far-off days to those recent times
when Thomas Carlyle had his home in one
of its quiet streets. To a boy with any turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
for reading and any taste for history and literature,
all that quarter of London on both sides
of the Thames must have been filled with
inspiration. John Burns had always a love of
reading, and I can easily fancy that the memories
of the place must have been a constant
stimulant and inspiration to his honorable
ambition for self-culture. His school days finished
when he was hardly ten years old, and
then he was set to earn a living, first in a
candle factory and afterwards in the works of
an engineer. Thus he toiled away until he had
reached manhood's age, and all the time he was
steadily devoting his spare hours or moments
to the task of self-education. He read every
book that came within his reach, and studied
with especial interest the works of men who
set themselves to the consideration of great
social problems.</p>

<p>Burns naturally became very soon impressed
with the conviction that all could not be quite
right under a political and social system which
made the workingman a mere piece of living
mechanism and gave him no share whatever in
the constitutional government of the country.
At that time there was no system of national
education in England, and the child of poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
parents had to get his teaching through some
charitable institution, or to go without any
teaching whatever. So far as the education of
the poorest classes was concerned, England
was at that time far below Scotland, below
Germany and Holland, and below the United
States.</p>

<p>As regards the political system, a man of the
class to which John Burns was born had little
chance indeed of obtaining the right to vote at
a Parliamentary election, which was given only
to men who had certain qualifications of income
and of residence not often to be found among
the working classes. The English system of
national education is little more than thirty
years old, and the extension of the voting power
which makes it now practically a manhood suffrage
is likewise of very modern date. It was
natural that an intelligent and thoughtful boy
like John Burns should, under such conditions,
become filled with socialistic doctrines and
should find himself growing into a mood of
impatience and hostility towards the rule of
aristocrats, landlords, and capitalists, by which
the country was then dominated. Soon after
he had reached his twenty-first year he obtained
employment as a foreman engineer on the Niger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in Africa, and there he had his first experience
of a climate and a life totally unlike to anything
that could be found in the Battersea regions.
I have often heard it said that during his employment
in English steamers on the Niger he
was known among his British companions as
"Coffee-pot Burns," in jocular recognition of
his devotion to total abstinence principles. He
spent about a year in his African occupation,
and during that time he had managed to save
up a considerable amount of his pay, a saving
which we may be sure was in great measure
due to his practice of total abstinence from any
drinks stronger than that which was properly
contained in the coffee-pot. When he left
Africa, he invested his savings in a manner
which I cannot but regard as peculiarly characteristic
of him, and which must have given to
such a man a profitable return for his investment&mdash;he
spent his savings, in fact, on a tour
of several months throughout Europe. Thus
he acquired an invaluable addition to his stock
of practical observation and a fresh impulse to
his studies of life and of books. He settled
down in England as a working engineer, and
he soon began to take a deep interest and an
active share in every movement which had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
its object the welfare of the classes who live by
daily labor.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are many improvements in
the condition of such men which could only
be brought about by legislation, and John Burns
therefore became a political agitator. His voice
was heard from the platforms of great popular
meetings held in and around London and in
many other parts of the country, and he was
one of the leaders of the great agitation which
secured for the public the right of holding open-air
meetings in Trafalgar Square. John Burns
was meant by nature to be a popular orator.
He has a physical frame which can stand any
amount of exertion, and his voice, at once
powerful and musical, can make itself heard to
the farthest limit of the largest outdoor meeting
in Hyde Park or Trafalgar Square. But he is
in no sense whatever a mere declaimer. He
argues every question out in a practical and
reasonable way, and although he has some views
on political and industrial subjects which many
of his opponents would condemn as socialistic,
there is nothing in him of the revolutionist or
the anarchist. His object is to bring about by
free and lawful public debate those reforms in
the political and industrial systems which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
regards as essential to the well-being of the
whole community. The Conservative party in
this country used to have for a long time one
particular phrase which was understood to embody
the heaviest accusation that could be
brought against a public man. To say that
this or that public speaker was endeavoring to
"set class against class" was understood to
mean his utter condemnation in the minds of
all well-behaved citizens. We do not hear so
much of this accusation in later days, partly
because some of the very measures demanded
by those setters of class against class have been
adopted by Conservative Governments and carried
into law by Conservative votes. But there
was a period in the life of John Burns when
he must have found himself denounced almost
every day in speech or newspaper article as
one whose main endeavor was to set class
against class. John Burns does not seem to
have troubled himself much about the accusation.
Perhaps he reasoned within himself that
if the endeavor to obtain for workingmen the
right of voting at elections and the right to
form themselves into trades-unions for the purpose
of bettering their lives were the endeavor
to set class against class, then there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for it but to go on setting class against class
until the beneficent result be obtained. So
John Burns went on setting class against class,
with the result that he became recognized all
over the country as one of the most eloquent,
capable, and judicious leaders whom the workingmen
could show, and his unselfishness and
integrity were never disparaged even by his
most extreme political opponents.</p>

<p>A remarkable evidence was soon to be given
of the solid reputation which he had won for
himself in public life. A complete change was
made by Parliamentary legislation in the whole
system of London's municipal government. The
vast metropolis which we call London was up
to that time under the control for municipal
affairs of the various parish boards and local
vestries, each of them constructed on some representative
system peculiarly its own, and none
of them, it may be justly said, under any direct
control from the great mass of the community.
The greater part of the West End of London
was under the management of a body known
as the Metropolitan Board of Works; the City
of London was dominated by its own historic
Corporation; each other district of the metropolis
had its governing vestry or some such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
institution. Apart from all other objections to
such a system, one of its obvious defects was
that no common principle was recognized in
the municipal arrangements of the metropolis;
there were no common rules for their regulation
of traffic, for the levying of rates, for the
management of public institutions, and a Londoner
who changed his residence from one
part of the town to another, or even from one
side of a street to another, might find himself
suddenly brought under the control of a system
of municipal regulations with which he was
totally unfamiliar. Appeals were constantly
made by enlightened Londoners for some uniform
system of London government, but for a
long time nothing was done in the way of
reform. At last, however, it happened&mdash;luckily,
in one sense, for the community&mdash;that the
Metropolitan Board of Works, which ruled the
West End districts, became the cause of much
public scandal because of its mistakes and mismanagement,
not to use any harsher terms,
in the dealing with public contracts. The
excitement caused by these discoveries made it
impossible for the old system to be maintained
any longer, and the result was the passing of
an Act of Parliament which created an entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
new governing body for the metropolis. This
new governing body was styled the London
County Council, and it was to have control of
the whole metropolis, with the exception of that
comparatively small extent of municipal territory
which we know as the City of London.
The members of the new County Council were
to be chosen, for the most part, as are the
members of the House of Commons, by direct
popular suffrage. Some of the foremost men
in England became members of the new County
Council. One of these was Lord Rosebery,
another was Sir Thomas Farrer (who has since
become Lord Farrer), a third was Frederic
Harrison, one of the most eminent writers and
thinkers of his time, and another was John
Burns, the working engineer. I mention this
fact only to show how thoroughly John Burns
must have established his reputation as a man
well qualified to take a leading place in the
municipal government of London. Since that
time he has been elected again and again to
the same position.</p>

<p>When the great dispute broke out in London
between the dock-laborers and the ship-owners,
John Burns took an active and untiring part
in the endeavor to obtain fair terms for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
workers, and by his moderation and judgment,
as well as by his inexhaustible energy, he did
inestimable service in the bringing about of
a satisfactory settlement. The late Cardinal
Manning took a conspicuous part in the effort
to obtain good terms for the workingmen, and
he was recognized on both sides of the dispute
as a most acceptable mediator, and I remember
that he expressed himself more than once in
the highest terms as to the services rendered
by John Burns during the whole of the crisis.
Burns made one or two unsuccessful attempts
to obtain a seat in the House of Commons&mdash;or
perhaps, to put it more correctly, I should
say that he consented, in obedience to the pressure
of his friends and followers, to become a
candidate for a seat. In 1892 he was elected
to Parliament as the representative of that Battersea
district where his life began, and he has
held the seat ever since. In the House of
Commons he has been a decided success. It
is only right to say that the workingmen
representatives, who now form a distinct and
influential section in the House, have fully vindicated
their right to hold places there, and
have, with hardly any exception, done honor to
the choice of their constituents. John Burns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is among the foremost, if not the very foremost,
of the working class representatives. He has
won the good opinions of all parties and classes
in the House of Commons. He has won especial
merit which counts for much in the House&mdash;he
never makes a speech unless when he
has something to say which has a direct bearing
on the debate in progress and which it is important
that the House should hear. He is
never a mere declaimer, and he never speaks
for the sake of making a speech and having it
reported in the newspapers. The House always
knows that when John Burns rises he has some
solid argument to offer, and that he will sit
down as soon as he has said his say.</p>

<p>The first time I had the honor of becoming
personally acquainted with John Burns was in
the House of Commons, shortly after his first
election, and I was introduced to him by my
friend Michael Davitt. I could not help feeling
at the time that it was a remarkable event
in one's life to be introduced to John Burns by
Michael Davitt. Both these men were then
honored members of the House of Commons,
and both had for many years been regarded by
most of what are called the ruling classes as
disturbers of the established order of things and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
enemies of the British Constitution. Davitt
had spent years in prison as a rebel, and Burns
had been at least once imprisoned, though but
for a short time, as a disturber of public order.
Every one came to admit in the end that each
man was thoroughly devoted to a cause which
he believed rightful, and that the true and lasting
prosperity of a State must depend largely
on men who are thus willing to make any
sacrifice for the maintenance of equal political
rights in the community. I have had, since
that time, many opportunities of meeting with
Burns in public and private and exchanging
ideas with him on all manner of subjects, and I
can only say that the better I have known him
the higher has been my opinion of his intelligence,
his sincerity, and his capacity to do the
State some service.</p>

<p>John Burns has made himself very useful in
the committee work of the House of Commons.
The House hands over the manipulation and
arrangement of many of its measures on what
I may call technical subjects&mdash;measures concerning
trade and industry, shipping and railways,
and other such affairs of business&mdash;to
be discussed in detail and put into working
shape by small committees chosen from among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the members; and these measures, when they
have passed through this process of examination,
are brought up for full and final settlement
in the House itself. It will be easily understood
that there are many subjects of this order,
on which the practical experience and the varied
observation of a man like Burns must count for
much in the shaping of legislation. Burns has
genial, unpretending manners, and although he
was born with a fighting spirit, he is not one of
those who make it their effort to cram their
opinions down the throats of their opponents.
Although his views are extreme on most of the
questions in which he takes a deep interest,
he is always willing to admit that there may be
something to be said on the other side of the
controversy; he is ever ready to give a full consideration
to all the arguments of his fellow-members,
and if any one in the committee can
show him that he is mistaken on this or that
point, he will yield to the force of argument,
and has no hesitation about acknowledging a
change in his views. Fervent as he is in his
devotion to any of the great principles which
have become a faith with him, there is nothing
of the fanatic about him, and I do not think his
enemies would ever have to fear persecution at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his hands. There is no roughness in his manners,
although he has certainly not been brought
up to the ways of what is generally known as
good society; and his smile is winning and
sweet. He has probably a certain consciousness
of mental strength, as he has of physical
strength, which relieves him from any inclination
towards self-assertion. I should find it as
difficult to believe that John Burns countenanced
a deed of oppression as I should find it
to believe that he sought by obsequiousness
the favor of the great.</p>

<p>John Burns was, it is almost needless to say,
an opponent from the very beginning of the
policy which led to the war against the South
African Republics. When the general election
came on, about midway in the course of the
war, the war passion had come upon the country
like an epidemic, and some of the most
distinguished English representatives lost their
seats in the House of Commons because they
refused to sanction the Jingo policy. Many
men who were rising rapidly into Parliamentary
distinction were defeated at the elections
by Imperialist candidates. Nor were the men
thus shut out from Parliament for the time
all members of the Liberal party. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
instances, although few indeed, there were men
belonging to the Conservative, the Ministerial,
side, who could not see the justice of the war
policy and would not conceal their opinions,
and who therefore had to forfeit their seats
when some thoroughgoing Tory Imperialists
presented themselves as rivals for the favor of
the local voters. So great was the influence of
the war passion that even among the constituencies
where the workingmen were strong there
were examples of an Imperialist victory over
the true principles of liberty and democracy.
But the Battersea constituents of John Burns
remained faithful to their political creed and to
him, and he was sent back in triumph to the
House of Commons to carry on the fight for
every good cause there. He took part in many
debates during the continuance of the campaign,
and he never made a speech on the
subject of the war which was not listened to
with interest even by those most opposed to his
opinions. He has the gift of debate as well as
the gift of declamation, and he knows his part
in Parliamentary life far too well to substitute
declamation for debate. The typical demagogue,
as he is pictured by those who do not
sympathize with democracy, would on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
occasions have merely relieved his mind by
repeated denunciations of that war in particular
and of wars in general, and would soon have
lost any hold on the attention of the House,
which is, to do it justice, highly practical in its
methods of discussion. John Burns spoke in
each debate on the war when he had something
to say which could practically and precisely
bear on the subject then under immediate
consideration&mdash;a question connected with the
administration of the campaign, with the manner
in which the War Office or the Colonial
Office was conducting some particular part
of its administrative task, with the immediate
effects of this or that movement, and in this
way he compelled attention and he challenged
reply. I remember, for instance, that when
the spokesmen of the Government were laying
great stress on the severity and injustice of the
Boer State's dealings with the native populations
of South Africa, John Burns gave from
his own experience and observation instances
of the manner in which African populations
had been dealt with by British authorities,
and demanded whether such actions would not
have justified the intervention of some European
State if the conduct of the Boer Govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>ment,
supposing it to be accurately described,
was a justification for England's invasion of
the Boer territory. Whenever he took part
in the debate, he met his opponents on their
own ground, and he challenged their policy in
practical detail, instead of wasting his time in
mere declamatory appeals to principles of liberty
and justice which would have fallen flat
upon the minds of those who held it as their
creed that Imperial England was free to dictate
her terms to all peoples of inferior strength
and less highly developed civilization.</p>

<p>John Burns has fairly won for himself an
honorable place in the history of our time. If
he had done nothing else, he would have accomplished
much by demonstrating in his own
person the right of the workingman to have a
seat in Parliament. One finds it hard now to
understand how the English House of Commons
could ever have been regarded as the
representative ruling body of England, when
it held no members who were authorized by
position and by experience to speak for the
working populations of the country. I mean
no disparagement to the other representatives
of the working classes when I say that I regard
John Burns as the most distinguished and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
most influential among them. Others of the
same order have rendered valuable service, not
merely to their own class, but to the State in
general since they came to hold seats in the
House of Commons; some have even held
administrative office in a Liberal Government,
and have shown themselves well qualified for
the duties. Not any of them, so far as I can
recollect, has ever shown himself the mere declaimer
and demagogue whom so many Conservative
observers and critics used to tell us
we must expect to meet if the workingmen
were enabled to send their spokesmen into the
House of Commons. I do not know whether
John Burns has any ambition to hold a seat in
some future Liberal Ministry, but I venture to
think that if such should be his fortune, he will
prove himself more useful than ever to the best
interests of his country. He has never sought
to obtain the favor and the support of his
own order by flattering their weaknesses, by
encouraging them in their errors, or by allowing
them to believe that the right must always
be on their side and the wrong on the side of
their opponents. I fully believe that he has
good and great work yet to do.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<h2>SIR MICHAEL HICKS-BEACH</h2>

<p class="p2">Sir Michael Hicks-Beach is now, as everybody
knows, out of office. <i>Il reviendra</i>, no
doubt, and in a happier sense, we may trust,
than fate allowed to the once famous personage
concerning whom the words I have quoted were
said and sung throughout France. <i>Il reviendra</i>
was the burden of the chant composed to the
honor of the late General Boulanger and echoed
through all the French music-halls at the time
when Boulanger got into trouble with the existing
government. But Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
is a man of very different order from
Boulanger, with whom he has, so far as I know,
nothing whatever in common except the fact
that they were both born in the same year,
1837.</p>

<p>The admirers of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
may take it for granted that he will some time
or other return to a high position in an English
administration. Whether that administration
is to be Liberal or Conservative we must wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for events to show. One can imagine the formation
of a Conservative Government which
might rise to the level of Hicks-Beach; or one
might imagine the formation of a Liberal Government
in which Hicks-Beach could see his
way to take office; but I think it would be hard
to realize the idea of such a man being left out
of office or kept out of office for many years.
He was, according to my judgment, the most
efficient and capable member of the Conservative
Government now in office, the Government
from which he felt himself compelled to withdraw,
or in which, at all events, he was not
pressed to continue. He was not a brilliant
figure in that Government. He had not the
push and the energy and the impressive debating
powers of Mr. Chamberlain, and he had not
the culture, the grace, and the literary style of
Mr. Arthur Balfour. He made no pretensions
whatever to the gift of oratory, although he had
some at least of the qualities which are needed
for oratorical success. His style of speaking is
remarkably clear and impressive. No question,
however complex and difficult, seems hard to
understand when explained by Hicks-Beach.
He compels attention rather than attracts it.
There are no alluring qualities in his eloquence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
there are no graces of manner or exquisite forms
of expression; there is a cold, almost harsh
clearness enforcing itself in every speech. The
speaker seems to be telling his hearers that,
whether they agree with him or not, whether they
like him or not, they must listen to what he has
to say. There is a certain quality of antagonism
in his manner from first to last, and he
conveys the idea of one who feels a grim satisfaction
in the work of hammering his opinions
into the heads of men who would rather be
thinking of something else if the choice were
left to them. "Black Michael" is the nickname
familiarly applied to Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
in private conversation by the members
of the House of Commons, and the nickname
has found its way into the columns of "Punch"
and other periodicals. The term "Black Michael"
does not, we may assume, refer merely
to the complexion of Hicks-Beach, to the color
of his hair; but means to suggest a grim dark-someness
about his whole expression of countenance
and bearing. Certainly any one who
watches Sir Michael Hicks-Beach as he sits
during a debate in the House of Commons,
waiting for his turn to reply to the attacks on
some measure of which he is a supporter, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
easily understand the significance of the appellation.
Hicks-Beach follows every sentence of
the speaker then addressing the House with a
stern and ironical gaze of intensity which seems
already to foredoom the unlucky orator to a
merciless castigation. I must say that if I were
a member of the House of Commons devoted
to the championship of some not quite orthodox
financial theory, I should not like to know
that my exposition of the doctrine was to be
publicly analyzed by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach.</p>

<p>Yet Hicks-Beach is not by any means an ungenial
man, according to my observation. Some
of his colleagues say that he has a bad temper,
or at least a quick temper; and I must say that
I can easily understand how a man of vigorous
intelligence and expansive views might occasionally
be brought into a mood of unphilosophic
acrimony by the goings-on of the present
Conservative administration. During my many
years of service in the House of Commons I
had opportunities of coming into personal intercourse
with Hicks-Beach, and I have always
found him easy of approach and genial in his
manners. At different times while he was
holding office I had to make representations
to him privately with regard to some difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
arising between an administrative department
and certain localities which felt themselves
oppressed, or at least put at a disadvantage,
by the working of new regulations. I always
found Sir Michael Hicks-Beach ready to give
a full and fair consideration to every complaint
and to exercise his authority for the removal of
any genuine grievance. But I can easily understand
that observers who have not had personal
dealings with Hicks-Beach and have only
observed him as he sits silent, dark, and grim
during some debate in the House of Commons,
may well have formed some very decided impressions
as to his habitual moods and tempers.
A member of the House once asked me whether
I was aware of the fact that a certain line in
one of Macaulay's "Lays of Ancient Rome"
was supposed to contain a prophetic description
of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach. I gave up the
puzzle, and then my friend told me that the
description was contained in the lines describing
the Roman trumpet-call which tell that</p>

<div class="center">
"The kite knows well the long stern swell."
</div>

<p>I hope my American readers will not have
quite forgotten the meaning of the term "swell,"
now somewhat falling into disuse, but at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
time very commonly employed in England to
describe a member of what would now be called
"smart society."</p>

<p>Sir Michael Hicks-Beach has held many
offices. He has been Under-Secretary for the
Home Department, and Secretary to the Poor
Law Board; he has been twice Chief Secretary
for Ireland, or, to speak more strictly, Chief Secretary
to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland; and
he has been twice Chancellor of the Exchequer.
I need hardly say that he was not able to accomplish
much during the periods of his Irish administration.
I have said in preceding articles
that it is not possible for the Chief Secretary
of a Conservative Government to accomplish
anything worth attempting in the work of
Irish administration. What Ireland demands
is the right to manage her own national affairs
in her own domestic Parliament, and there is
nothing worth doing to be done by any government
which will not take serious account of her
one predominant claim. No patronage of local
charities, local flower shows, and local racecourses,
no amount of Dublin Castle hospitalities,
no vice-regal visits to public schools and
municipal institutions, can bring about any real
improvement in the relations between Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Britain and Ireland. I have no doubt that
Hicks-Beach did all in his power to see that
the business of his department was efficiently
and honestly conducted in Dublin Castle, but
under the conditions imposed upon him by
Conservative principles it was impossible for
him to accomplish any success in the administration
of Irish affairs. It has often come into
my mind that a certain sense of his limitations
in this way was sometimes apparent in the bearing
and manner of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,
when he had to take any prominent part in the
business of Dublin Castle. He has an active
mind and a ready faculty of initiative, and there
was no place for such a man in the sort of administrative
work which mainly consists in the
endeavor to keep things going as they have
been going, and striving after an impossible
compromise between despotic principles and a
free constitutional system.</p>

<p>Hicks-Beach, of course, was more in his
place when at the head of the financial department
of the administration. He is admitted to
have been one of the most skillful and enlightened
among modern Chancellors of the Exchequer.
His financial statements were always
thoroughly clear, symmetrical, and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from first to last. He never got into any entanglement
with his figures, and his array of
facts was always marshaled with something like
dramatic skill. I do not profess to be very
strong upon financial questions, but I could
always understand and follow with the deepest
interest any financial exposition made by Hicks-Beach.
He seemed to me to be distinctly above
the level of his party and his official colleagues
on all such questions, and it has often occurred
to me that such a man was rather thrown away
upon a Conservative Government. Whatever
else might be said against them, it could not be
said that his speeches at any time sank to the
level of the commonplace. There was something
combative in his nature, and his style of
speaking, with its clear, strong, and sometimes
almost harsh tones, appeared as if it were designed
in advance to confront and put down all
opposition. The House of Commons had for
a long time got into the way of regarding Hicks-Beach
as a man in advance of his colleagues on
all subjects of financial administration. Every
Tory in office, or likely to be in office, now professes
himself a free-trader, in the English sense
of the phrase, but Sir Michael Hicks-Beach was
evidently a genuine free-trader, and never could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
have been anything else since he first turned
his attention seriously and steadily to financial
questions. I should describe him as one of the
foremost debaters in the House of Commons
among the men who made no pretensions to
the higher order of eloquence; and probably an
additional attraction was given to his speeches
by that aggressive and combative tone which I
have just noticed. I have sometimes fancied
that his combativeness of manner and his dictatorial
style were less intended for the discomfiture
of his recognized political opponents than
for that of his own colleagues in office. Long
before there was any rumor of incompatibility
between Hicks-Beach and the members of the
present Government, I have often found myself
wondering how the man who expressed such
enlightened ideas on so many financial and
political questions could possibly get on with a
somewhat reactionary Conservative administration.
Of course I have no means of knowing
anything beyond that which is known to the
general public concerning the causes which led
to Hicks-Beach's withdrawal or exclusion from
his place in the present Government. Even
those London journals which profess to know
everything about the inner councils of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Cabinet did not, and do not, tell us anything
more on this particular subject than the news,
impossible to be concealed, that Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach had ceased to be a member of the
Conservative administration. We were all left
to make any conjectures we pleased as to the
cause of this remarkable change, and I feel,
therefore, no particular diffidence in expounding
my own theory. During the long debates
on Hicks-Beach's latest Budget proposals,
which I had to follow only through the medium
of the newspaper reports, I became possessed
with the idea that Hicks-Beach was performing
reluctantly an uncongenial and almost intolerable
task.</p>

<p>Let me recall to the minds of my readers
some of the conditions amid which Hicks-Beach
found himself compelled of late to carry
on his work. It should be said, in the first
instance, that he never showed himself, and, as
I believe, never could have been, a genuine
Tory of the old school. He never exhibited
himself as an uncompromising partisan on any
of the great subjects which arouse political
antagonism. He must have had very little
sympathy indeed with the dogmas and the
watchwords and the war-cries of old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
militant Toryism. He never identified himself
with the cause of the Orangemen in Ireland or
the principles of the Jingoes in England. He
seldom addressed the House of Commons on
any subjects but those which belonged to his
own department, and these were for the most
part questions of finance. When, however, he
had occasionally to take part in debates on subjects
connected with England's foreign policy,
he generally spoke with an enlightenment, a
moderation, and a conciliatory tone which would
have done credit to any statesman and seemed
little in keeping with the policy and the temper
of modern Toryism. But Hicks-Beach had
fallen upon evil days for a man of his foresight,
his intellect, and his temperament generally
who had found a place in a Conservative Cabinet.
The policy which led to the outbreak
of the war in South Africa aroused a passion
in the English public mind which found its
utmost fury among the partisans of Toryism.
Tory and Jingo became for the time synonymous
terms. The man who did not allow
his heart and soul to be filled with the war
spirit must have seemed to most of his friends
unworthy to be called a Conservative. Even
among certain sections of the Liberals it re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>quired
much courage for any man to condemn
or even to criticise with severity the policy
which had led to the war. Any one who ventured
on such a course, whether he were Liberal
or Conservative, was straightway branded
with the opprobrious epithet of pro-Boer, and
that title was supposed to carry his complete
condemnation. England had come back suddenly
to the same kind of passionate temper
which prevailed during the earlier part of the
Crimean War. "He who is not with us is
against us," cried the professing patriots at
both times&mdash;he who does not glorify the war
is a traitor to his own country and a pro-Boer,
or a pro-Russian, as the case might be. This
was the temper with which Hicks-Beach found
that he had to deal during the later years of
his financial administration.</p>

<p>It would be out of place to enter into any
speculation as to what Hicks-Beach's own views
may have been with regard to the whole policy
of the war. It is now well known that Queen
Victoria was entirely opposed to that policy,
although she did not feel that her position as a
constitutional sovereign gave her authority to
overrule it by a decision of her own. There is
very good reason to believe that peace was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
brought about at last by the resolute exercise
of King Edward's influence. It is at least not
unlikely that a man of Hicks-Beach's intellect
and temperament may have been opposed at
first to the policy which brought on the war,
but may have, nevertheless, believed that his
most patriotic course would be to remain in
the Government and do the best he could for
the public benefit. He soon found himself
compelled to perform as disagreeable a task as
an enlightened financial statesman could have
to undertake&mdash;the task of extracting from the
already overburdened taxpayers the means of
carrying on a war of conquest with which he
had little sympathy. It was perfectly evident
that the needed revenue could not be extracted
from the country without some violation of
those financial principles to which Hicks-Beach
had long been attached. There was no time
for much meditation&mdash;the money had to be
found somehow&mdash;and a great part of it could
only be found by the imposition of a duty on
foreign imports. We now know from public
statements made by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
himself that while the war was going on he
became impressed with the conviction that the
whole administration of the military department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was grossly mismanaged, and that the money
of the nation was thrown away when the War
Office came to spend it. The conviction thus
forced upon him could not have tended to make
the task of providing means for such further
expenditure any the more agreeable to him.
We may assume that he saw no other course
before him than to make the best of a bad job
and try to find in the least objectionable way
the amount of money necessary to carry on the
business of the State. It was evident to him
that the principles of free trade must be put
aside for the present, and he found himself
driven to the odious necessity of imposing a
duty on the importation of foreign corn, a duty
which in fact amounted to a tax on bread.
Hicks-Beach well knew that no tax could be
more odious to the poorer classes of the British
Islands; but we may presume that in his
emergency he could see no other way of raising
the money, and he accepted the situation with a
dogged resolve which made no pretense at any
concealment of his personal dislike for the task.
His manner of delivering the speech in which
he set forth his scheme of finance was that of a
man who has to discharge an odious duty, or
what he finds himself by the force of circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>stances
compelled to regard as a duty, but will
utter no word which might seem to make out
that he has any excuse other than that of hateful
necessity. The substance of Hicks-Beach's
explanations on this part of his budget might
be summed up in such words as these: "We
have got to pay for this war, and we have no
time to spare in finding the money; we must
cast aside for the time the principles of free
trade; but do not let us further degrade ourselves
by hypocritical attempts to make out
that what we are doing is in accordance with
the free-trade doctrine." I remember well that
on reading Hicks-Beach's budget speech I
became deeply impressed with the conviction
that his task was becoming so intolerable to
him that we might expect before long to see a
change in the composition of the Government.
But it appeared to me that, as the debate went
on and the days went on, the position of Hicks-Beach
was becoming more and more difficult.
Some of the members of the Cabinet became
to all appearance suddenly possessed with an
inspiration that the time had arrived for a bold
movement of reaction against the long-accepted
doctrines of free trade. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer had already receded so far from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
established policy as to propose the imposition
of a tax on the imported materials for making
bread; and why, therefore, should we not take
advantage&mdash;thus at least I construed their
ideas&mdash;of this tempting opportunity to introduce
a system of preferential duties and an
imitation Zollverein for England and some of
her colonies, and to break away from the creed
and dogmas of men like Gladstone, Cobden, and
Bright? These proposals must have opened to
the eyes of Hicks-Beach a vista of financial
heresies into which he could not possibly enter.
He probably thought that he had gone far
enough in the way of compromise when he
consented to meet immediate emergencies by
the imposition of a bread-tax. Is it possible
that he may have felt some compunctious visiting
because of his having yielded so far to the
necessities of the moment? However that may
be, I take it for granted, and took it for granted
at the time, that Hicks-Beach found the incompatibility
between his own views as to the
raising of revenue and the views beginning to
be developed by some of his colleagues becoming
more and more difficult to reconcile.</p>

<p>Let me venture on an illustration, although
it be not by any means photographic in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
accuracy, of the difficulty with which the Chancellor
of the Exchequer found himself confronted.
Let us suppose Hicks-Beach to be
the leader of a pledged society of total abstainers.
At a moment of sudden crisis he feels
called upon to relax so far the rigidity of the
society's governing principle as to allow one of
its members who is threatened with utter physical
prostration a few drops of alcoholic stimulant.
He finds his course cordially approved
by some of his most influential colleagues, and
at first he is proud of their support. But it
presently turns out that they regard his reluctant
concession as the opening up of a new
practice in their regulations, and they press
upon him all manner of propositions for the
toleration and even the encouragement of what
my friend Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the great English
champion of total abstinence, would term
"moderate drunkenness." Fancy what the feelings
of Sir Wilfrid Lawson would be if by some
temporary and apparently needful concession
he found himself regarded by those around
him as an advocate of moderate drunkenness!
Such, I cannot help thinking, must have been,
in its different way, the condition to which
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach felt himself brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
down, when he discovered that his introduction
of an import duty on foreign grain was believed
by his principal colleagues to be but the opening
of a reactionary movement against the
whole policy of free trade.</p>

<p>The Government of Lord Salisbury seemed to
be in the highest good spirits at the prospects before
them. Mr. Chamberlain in especial seemed
to believe that the time had come for him to
develop an entirely new system of his own for
the adjustment of import and export duties.
For many weeks the English newspapers were
filled with discussions on Mr. Chamberlain's
great project for the new British Imperial Zollverein,
of which England was to be the head.
Numbers of Mr. Chamberlain's Conservative
admirers were filled with a fresh enthusiasm
for the man who thus proposed to reverse
altogether the decisions of all modern political
economy laid down by Liberal statesmen and
Radical writers. Stout old Tory gentlemen
representing county constituencies began to
be full of hope that the good old times were
coming back.</p>

<p>That was the crisis&mdash;so far at least as the
official career of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach was
concerned for the time. What may have hap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>pened
in the private councils of the Government
we of the outer world were not and are
not permitted to know. All that we actually
do know is that Lord Salisbury resigned his
place as Prime Minister, that Arthur Balfour
was called to succeed him in office, and that
a new administration was formed in which the
name of Hicks-Beach did not appear. There
were other changes also made in the administration,
but with these I shall not for the
present concern myself. The important fact
for this article is that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
was no longer Chancellor of the Exchequer.
All manner of conjectures were made as to
the reasons why Lord Salisbury so suddenly
withdrew from the position of Prime Minister,
and why he could not be prevailed upon to
hold the place even nominally until after King
Edward's coronation. I do not suppose that
the resignation of Lord Salisbury had anything
to do with the fact that Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach ceased to be Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The vacancies were not made
simultaneously, nor did there appear any reason
to believe that Hicks-Beach was so closely
identified with the political fortunes of Lord
Salisbury as to be unable to remain in office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
when his leader had ceased to hold the place
of command. So far as an outsider can judge,
it must have been that Hicks-Beach could not
get on with the new administration, or that the
new administration could not get on with him.
My own theory, and I only offer it to my readers
as the theory of a mere observer from the
outside, is that Hicks-Beach could not stand
any more of the reaction towards protection
principles&mdash;thought he had gone quite as far
as any sense of duty to his party could exact
from him, and made up his mind that if his
colleagues were anxious to go any farther in
what he believed to be the wrong direction
they must do so without any help or countenance
from him.</p>

<p>This theory has taken a firmer hold than
ever of my mind since I read the report of a
speech lately made by Hicks-Beach weeks and
weeks after he had ceased to be Chancellor of
the Exchequer. That recent speech might have
been made by a member of the Liberal Opposition.
Certainly in some of its most important
and striking passages it enunciated opinions
and laid down doctrines which might have come
from almost any of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's
colleagues on the front Opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
bench. It denounced extravagant war expenditure
at a time when Imperialist politicians were
calling out for something very like military
conscription, and it insisted that the defense of
England by the strength of her navy ought to
be the main consideration of English statesmanship.
That is a doctrine which used to
be proclaimed in distant days by such men as
Cobden and Bright, which soon became an accepted
principle among all genuine Liberals, but
has lately been repudiated by all Imperialists,
Liberal or Tory, who seem to think that the
one great business of English statesmanship is
to turn England into a military encampment.
The natural and reasonable conclusion to be
drawn from such a speech is that during the
last session or two of Parliament Hicks-Beach
found it impossible to put up any longer with
the reign of Jingo principles in the Cabinet,
and made up his mind to set himself free from
such a domination. The Tory Government
has lost its ablest financial administrator, and
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach has regained his
position of independence.</p>

<p>The future must tell the story of Hicks-Beach's
remaining career. That he has yet an
important career before him may be taken for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
granted if only the fates allow him the ordinary
length of man's life. Nothing but absolute
retirement from Parliamentary work could reduce
such a man to a position of complete
neutrality, or could prevent him from having
an influence which the leaders of both political
parties must take into consideration. He is
too strong in debate, too well trained in the
business of administration, and too quick in
observing the real import of growing political
changes, and in distinguishing between them
and the mere displays of ephemeral emotion,
not to make his influence felt at any great crisis
in the conditions of political parties. I hold,
therefore, to the hope expressed at the opening
of this article, that <i>il reviendra</i>&mdash;that Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach will come back before
long to an important place in some administration.
The House of Commons could not
afford just now to lose the services of such a
man, and I take it for granted that Hicks-Beach
could not remain long in the House of
Commons without being called upon to accept
an official position. He is beyond question
one of the very ablest men on the side of the
Government in that House, and his integrity,
his moderation, his capacity to understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
significance of new facts, and his disinterestedness
have won for him the respect of all parties
in Parliament and outside it. We are, to all
appearance, on the eve of great changes in the
composition of our political parties. With the
close of the war has come to an end that season
of Jingoism which brought so many weak-minded
Liberals into fascinated co-operation
with the Tories. The reaction against Toryism
must come, and it will probably bring with it
a reconstitution of both parties on the principles
which each may consider essential to its
character at a time when peace at home gives
our legislators a chance of studying the domestic
welfare of the people in these islands. It
will not be enough then for a public man to
proclaim himself Imperialist in order to win
the votes of a constituency, or to denounce his
rival as a pro-Boer in order to secure defeat for
that unlucky personage. The constituencies
will begin to ask what each candidate proposes
to do for the domestic prosperity of our populations
at home, and to demand an explicit
answer. Under such conditions, whatever be
the reconstitution of parties, I am strongly of
opinion that Sir Michael Hicks-Beach will before
long begin a new administrative career.</p>

<h2>JOHN E. REDMOND</h2>

<p class="p2">John Edward Redmond is one of the leading
men in the House of Commons just now.
He is one of the very few really eloquent speakers
of whom the House can boast at the present
time. His eloquence is, indeed, of a kind but
rarely heard in either House of Parliament
during recent years. The ordinary style of
debate in the House of Commons is becoming
more and more of the merely conversational
order, and even when the speaker is very much
in earnest, even when he is carried away by
the fervor of debate, his emotion is apt to express
itself rather in an elevation of the voice
than in an exaltation of the style. Among
members of the House who may be still regarded
as having a career before them I do not
think there are more than three or four who
are capable of making a really eloquent speech&mdash;a
speech which is worth hearing for its style
and its language as well as for its information
and its argument. John Redmond is one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
these gifted few; Lloyd-George is another. I
have heard some critics depreciate John Redmond's
eloquence on the ground that it is
rather old-fashioned. If it be old-fashioned to
express one's meaning in polished and well-balanced
sentences, in brilliant phrasing, and
with melodious utterance, then I have to admit
that John Redmond is not, in his style of eloquence,
quite up to the present fashion, and I
can only say that it is so much the worse for
the present fashion. It is quite certain that
Redmond is accepted by the House of Commons
in general as one of its most eloquent speakers
and one of its ablest party leaders.</p>

<p>Redmond has already been some twenty
years in the House of Commons. He was a
very young man when first chosen to represent
an Irish constituency in the House. I have
noticed that our biographical dictionaries of
contemporary life do not agree as to the date
of Redmond's birth. Some of the books set
him down as born in 1851, while others give
the year of his birth as 1856. I think I have
good reason for knowing that the latter date is
the correct one. Perhaps it ought to bring a
sense of gratification to a public man when a
dispute arises as to the date of his birth. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
may give him a complacent reminder of the
fact that certain cities disputed as to Homer's
birthplace.</p>

<p>John Redmond comes of a good family, and
his father was for a long time a member of the
House of Commons. I can remember the elder
Redmond very well, and he was a man of the
most courteous bearing and polished manners,
a man of education and capacity, who, whenever
he spoke in debate, spoke well and to the
point, and was highly esteemed by all parties
in the House. John Redmond was educated
at Trinity College, Dublin, studied for the law
and was called to the bar, but did not practice
in the profession. He was elected to the House
of Commons in 1881, and became a member
of that National party which had been formed
not long before under the guidance of Charles
Stewart Parnell. From the time when he first
took part in a Parliamentary debate it was evident
that John Redmond had inherited his
father's graceful manner of speaking, and it was
soon discovered that he possessed a faculty of
genuine eloquence which had not been displayed
by the elder Redmond. John Redmond
had and still has a voice of remarkable strength,
volume, and variety of intonation, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
soon afforded ample opportunity of testing his
capacity for public speech. It was a great part
of Parnell's policy that there should be a powerful
Home Rule organization extending itself
over all parts of Great Britain, founding institutions
in all the principal cities and towns, and
addressing audiences indoors and out on the
subject of Ireland's demand for domestic self-government.
John Redmond soon became one
of the most effective organizers of this new
movement and one of the most powerful pleaders
of the cause on public platforms. The first
time I ever heard him make a speech in public
was at a great open-air meeting held in Hyde
Park. He had to address a vast crowd, and I
felt naturally anxious to know what his success
might be under such trying conditions
for a young speaker. He had then but a slender
frame, and his somewhat delicately molded
features did not suggest the idea of great lung-power.
After his first sentence I felt no
further doubt as to his physical capacity. He
had a magnificent voice, clear, resonant, and
thrilling, which made itself heard all over the
crowd without the slightest apparent effort on
the part of the speaker. I could not help being
struck at the time by the seeming contrast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
between the boyish, delicate figure and the easy
strength of the resonant voice.</p>

<p>During his earlier sessions in the House of
Commons Redmond did not speak very often,
but when he did speak he made it clear that he
had at his command a gift of genuine eloquence.
He held office as one of the whips of
the Irish National party&mdash;that is to say, as
one of the chosen officials whose duty it is to
look after the arrangements of the party, to see
that its members are always in their places at
the right time, to settle as to the speakers who
are to take part in each debate, and to enter
into any necessary communications with the
whips of the other parties in the House. Redmond
was a man admirably suited for such
work. He had had an excellent education;
he had the polished manners of good society;
he belonged to what I may call the country
gentleman order, and could ride to hounds
with a horsemanship which must have won the
respect of the Tory squires from the hunting
counties; and he had an excellent capacity and
memory for all matters of arrangement and
detail. He attended to his duties as one of the
party whips with unfailing regularity, and could
exercise with equal skill and effect the influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>ence
of persuasiveness and that of official command.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Parnell party there
was not, to be sure, any great demand on the
marshaling power of the whips over the rank
and file of the little army. For a considerable
time the whole Parnellite party did not consist
of more than ten or a dozen members. These
members, however, were compelled to do constant
duty, and to maintain the great game of
Parliamentary obstruction revived by Parnell at
all hours of the day and the night. It was quite
a common thing for a member of the party to
deliver a dozen or fifteen speeches in the course
of a single sitting, and John Redmond had all his
work to do in endeavoring to keep exhausted colleagues
up to their business and to see that they
did not leave the precincts of the House until
Mr. Speaker should have formally announced
that the day's sitting was over. Redmond's services
were of inestimable value during such a
period of trial. As the days went on, the Irish
constituencies became more and more aroused
to the necessity of increasing as far as possible
the number of thoroughgoing Parnellites in the
House by getting rid, at every election, of the
Irish members&mdash;Irish Whigs as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
called&mdash;who did not go in thoroughly, heart
and soul, for the policy of Parnell. Under such
conditions the influence and the eloquence of
John Redmond were of the most substantial
service to his party in the work of stirring up
the national sentiment among the Irish populations
in the cities and towns of England and
Scotland. Before many years had passed, John
Redmond was one of the whips of an Irish
National party in the House of Commons
which numbered nearly ninety members. The
increase of official duties thus put upon him
and his brother whips did not seem to trouble
him in the slightest degree. He was always on
duty in the House, unless when he had to be on
duty at some public meeting outside its precincts;
he was ever in good spirits; could
always give his chief the fullest and most exact
information as to the conditions of each debate,
and the best methods of getting full use of the
numbers and the debating strength of the Irish
party at any given moment.</p>

<p>During the greater part of this time he had
not had much opportunity of cultivating his
faculty as a debater, for the whip of a party is
understood to be occupied rather in putting
other men up to speak than in displaying elo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>quence
of his own, and it was for several years
not quite understood by the party that John
Redmond was qualified to be and was destined
to be one of its most commanding spokesmen. I
ought to say that among other duties discharged
by John Redmond was the trying and responsible
task of traveling on more than one occasion
over the United States and Canada and
Australia to preach the Home Rule gospel to
the Irish populations in those countries and to
all others who would listen, and thus to obtain
the utmost possible support for the great movement
at home. For many sessions, however,
John Redmond was regarded by his colleagues
in the House as a speaker best heard to advantage
on some great public platform outside the
Parliamentary precincts, and very few of them
indeed had yet formed the idea that he was also
qualified to become one of the foremost orators
in the representative chamber itself.</p>

<p>I may mention here that Mr. Redmond's intimate
knowledge of the rules and practices of
the House and his thorough acquaintance with
its business ways were, in great measure, due to
his having held for a time a place in one of the
offices belonging to the House of Commons.
He was appointed, before he became a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the House, a clerk in the Vote Office, a department
which has to do with the preparation
of Parliamentary documents, the distribution of
Parliamentary papers, and other such technical
work. The clerkships in these offices are in
the gift of the Speaker, are an avenue towards
the highest promotions in the official staff of
the House, and are usually given to young men
who, in addition to high education and a promise
of capacity, can bring some Parliamentary
or family influence to bear on their behalf.
John Redmond had some experience in this
Vote Office, and it made him a thorough master
of Parliamentary business. I had enjoyed
his personal acquaintance for some time before
he came into the House as a member, and I
had been in the House myself some two years
before his election. I remember often seeing
him and exchanging a word with him as he
stood within the House itself, but just below
the line which marks the place where the bar
of the House is erected when there is occasion,
for any public purpose, to admit a stranger thus
far and no farther, in order that he may plead
some cause before the House or present some
petition. Officials employed in any of the offices
belonging to the House are allowed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
proud privilege of advancing up the floor of the
chamber as far as the chair occupied by the Sergeant-at-Arms,
the point at which the bar would
be drawn across if occasion should require.
Thus I had the opportunity of conversing with
John Redmond on the floor of the House itself,
before he had yet obtained the right of passing
beyond the sacred line of the bar.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that Parnell himself did
not, until the great crisis came in the Irish National
party, fully appreciate the political capacity
of John Redmond. Parnell always regarded
him as both useful and ornamental&mdash;useful in
managing the business of the party, and ornamental
as a brilliant speaker on a public platform.
But he did not appear to know, and had
indeed no means of knowing, that Redmond
had in himself the qualifications of a party leader
and the debating power which could make him
an influence in the House of Commons. The
speeches which Redmond made, or rather was
"put up" by his leader to make, in the House,
had often for their object merely to fill up time
and keep a debate going until the moment arrived
when Parnell thought a division ought to
be taken. But when the great crisis came in the
affairs of the party, then Redmond was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
able to prove himself made of stronger metal
than even his leader had supposed. The crisis
was, of course, when the Parnell divorce case
came on, and Gladstone and the Liberal leaders
generally became filled with the conviction that
it would be impossible to carry a measure of
Home Rule if Parnell were to retain the leadership
of the Irish National party. I need not
go over this old and painful story again; it is
enough to say that the great majority of Parnell's
own followers found themselves compelled
to believe that it would be better for
Ireland if Parnell were to resign the leadership
and retire into private life for a certain time.
This Parnell refused to do, and, in opposition
to the earnest wishes of the majority of his followers,
he published a sort of manifesto in
denunciation of Gladstone. Then came the
famous meetings of the Irish party in Committee-Room
No. 15&mdash;one of the committee-rooms
belonging to the House of Commons&mdash;and,
after long days of angry and sometimes even
fierce debate, the great majority of the party
declared that they could no longer follow the
leadership of Parnell. The minority made up
their minds to hold with Parnell for good or
evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>I am willing and always was willing to render
full justice to the motives which inspired
the action of the minority. They did not feel
themselves called upon to justify every act of
Parnell's private life, but they took the position
that his private life had nothing to do with his
political career, and that they could not abandon
the leader who had done such service to
Ireland merely because his name had become
associated with a public scandal. On the other
hand, the majority of the party, of whom I was
one, held that their first duty was to their country,
and that if the continued leadership of Parnell
rendered it impossible for Gladstone to
carry his Home Rule measure, they had to
think only of their country and its national
cause. During all these debates in Committee-Room
No. 15, John Redmond took the leading
part on the side of the minority. He became
the foremost champion of Parnell's leadership.
This position seemed to come to him as if in the
nature of things. I well remember the ability
and eloquence which he displayed in these debates,
and the telling manner in which he put
his arguments and his appeals. The course he
took was all the more to his credit because
Parnell had never singled him out as an object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of especial favors and, indeed, in the opinion of
many among us, had not done full justice to his
services in the House of Commons. Then
came the formal division of the party. The
majority met together and reconstituted the
party with a new Chairman, while the minority
associated themselves with Parnell as their
leader for the purpose of going over to Ireland
and endeavoring to organize the country in his
support. When the end of the fierce open
controversy was brought about at last by Parnell's
sudden death, John Redmond was made
the leader of the minority, and from that time
forth he began to give more and more distinct
evidences of his capacity for a Parliamentary
leader's position. He and his group of followers
kept themselves in the House of Commons entirely
apart from their former colleagues. John
Redmond had often to take a part in the debates
of the House, and every one could see
that the serious responsibility imposed on him
was developing in him qualities of leadership,
and even of statesmanship, which very few indeed
had previously believed to be among his
gifts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the state of things created in Ireland
by the split and the setting up of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
opposing parties was becoming intolerable.
Every man of patriotic feeling on either side
of the controversy was coming to see more
keenly every day that the maintenance of such
a division must be fatal to the cause, for at
least another generation. Some efforts were
made by the leading men on both sides to bring
about a process of reconciliation. John Dillon
on the one side, and John Redmond on the
other, lent every help they could to these patriotic
efforts. John Dillon had by this time become
leader of the more numerous party, having
been chosen to that position when the leader
elected after the severance from Parnell had
been compelled by ill health to resign the
place. Every reasonable man among the Irish
Nationalists, inside and outside Parliament, was
coming more and more to see that there was no
longer any occasion whatever for further severance,
and that the country demanded a return
to the old principle of union in the National
ranks. John Dillon became impressed with
the conviction that it might tend to smooth
matters and to open a better chance for reconciliation
if he, as one of the most conspicuous
anti-Parnellites, were to resign his position, and
to invite the whole party to come together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
again and elect a leader. Dillon was strongly
of opinion that, as all matter of controversy had
been buried in the early grave of Parnell, it
would be better for the cause of future union
that the new leader should be chosen from
among the small number of men who had
always adhered to Parnell's side. Dillon prevailed
upon most of his friends to adopt his
views on this subject. It was the custom of
the Irish National party&mdash;indeed, of both the
parties&mdash;to elect their leader at the opening
of each session, and John Dillon had been re-elected
more than once to the position of command
in his own party. Accordingly, at the
close of a session Dillon announced his intention
to resign the place of leader, and he added
to the announcement that he would not then
accept re-election, even if it should be offered
to him by a vote of his party. This patriotic
course of action was most happy in its results.
The Irish National members met together once
again as a united party, and the leadership was
conferred on John Redmond as an evidence
alike of the confidence which was felt in his
capacity and his sincerity, and a proof of the
desire entertained by the majority for a thorough
and cordial reunion of the whole party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>John Redmond was therefore the first leader
of the whole party since the events of Committee-Room
No. 15. John Dillon and his
immediate predecessor had been only leaders
of a majority, and now John Redmond was
chosen as the leader of the whole party representing
the Irish National cause in the House
of Commons. He settled down at once to his
new position with a temper and spirit admirably
suited to the work he had to undertake.
He seemed to have put away from his mind
all memory of disunion in the party, and he
became once more the friend as well as the
leader of every member enrolled in its ranks.
Many of those who formed the majority had
in the first instance only yielded to the persuasion
of John Dillon and others in the election
of Redmond as leader merely because they
believed that by such a course the interests of
the cause could best be served just then. But
I know that some of these men accepted with
personal reluctance what seemed to be the
necessity of the hour, and looked forward with
anything but gratification to the prospect of
having to serve under the new chief. John
Redmond, while defending the cause of the
still living Parnell, had shown in the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of his chief an energy and a passion which few
of us could have expected of him, and was
often utterly unsparing in his denunciation of
the men who maintained the other side of the
controversy. It was not unnatural that many of
his former opponents should feel some doubt
as to the possibility of working harmoniously
under the leadership of a man who had been
but lately so bitter an opponent. I had, at the
time of the new leadership, been compelled by
ill health to give up all active part in public
life, but I talked with many members of the
majority in the Irish party who told me frankly
that they feared it would not be possible to
get on under the leadership of John Redmond.
Before long, however, these same men spontaneously
assured me that they had changed
their opinions on that subject, and were glad
to find that they could work with Redmond
in perfect harmony, and that his manner and
bearing showed no sign whatever of any bitter
memories belonging to the days of internal
dispute. Redmond devoted himself absolutely
to the House of Commons and the business of
leadership, unless indeed when some pressing
national interests compelled him to leave his
place in St. Stephen's in order to see to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
organization of the National cause in Ireland
or in the United States. At the time when
I am writing this article he has but lately returned
from a visit of that kind to some of the
great cities of the American Republic.</p>

<p>Fortunately for his country as well as for
himself, John Redmond is a man of private
means, is not compelled to earn a living, and
can devote the whole of his time to the service
of the National cause. He is always to
be found at his post while the House of Commons
is sitting, and I believe that his morning
ride in Hyde Park with his wife every day is
one of the few recreations in which he allows
himself to indulge. I had not long ago a visit
from a well-known member of the Irish Parliamentary
party who holds one of its official
positions and was at the time of the internal
dispute an uncompromising opponent of Parnell's
continued rule. This friend of mine I
know was decidedly opposed at first to the
election of John Redmond as leader, for the
reason that he did not believe such an arrangement
could possibly work with smoothness and
satisfaction to the party. But when I saw
him lately, he assured me that he had entirely
changed his opinions and that he did not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>lieve
any party could possibly have a better
leader than John Redmond had already proved
himself to be. He had nothing but praise for
Redmond's bearing and ways, for the manner
in which he appeared to have banished from
his mind all memory of past disunion, and for
the unremitting attention with which he devoted
himself to the work of the party inside
and outside the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Since then I have heard and read nothing but
good accounts of the manner in which Redmond
has reorganized the party. It has under
his guidance become once again a powerful
force in political life. The House of Commons,
as a whole, has thoroughly recognized
Redmond's position, influence, and capacity.
The Prime Minister has given many proofs of
the importance which he attaches to Redmond's
decisions and movements. The new leader of
the Irish party has won a much higher rank as a
Parliamentary debater than he ever had attained
to in the days before he had become invested
with a really grave responsibility. The newspaper
critics on all sides of political life are
agreed in describing him as one of the foremost
living debaters. Indeed, there are but three or
four men in the House of Commons who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
possibly be compared with him for eloquence
and skill in debate, and there is a quality of
grace and artistic form in his style of eloquence
which often recalls the memories of brighter
days, when the art of oratory was still cultivated
in Parliament. The success with which
he has conducted the movements of his party
has compelled Ministerialists and Opposition
alike to take serious account of Redmond and
his followers when the chances of any great
political measure are under consideration. Only
quite lately, during the passage of the Education
measure, he adopted a policy which at first
greatly puzzled his opponents, and at the last
moment succeeded in impressing the Government
and the Ministerial party generally with
the conviction that Redmond understands when
and how to strike a decisive blow.</p>

<p>Of course we hear sometimes, and of late
rather often, about differences in the Irish party
itself, and about a threatened secession from
John Redmond's leadership. The Tory papers
in England, and even some of the journals
which are professedly Liberal, made eager use
of this supposed dissension, and endeavored to
persuade themselves and their readers that Redmond
has not a full hold over his followers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
over the Irish people. I may tell my American
readers that they will do well not to attach the
slightest importance to these stories about a
threatened secession from the lately reunited
Irish National party. In the first place, I
never heard of any political party which did
not inclose in its ranks some men who could
not always be reckoned on as amenable to
the discipline which is found necessary in
every political organization. There is a considerable
number of Liberal members who cannot
be counted on to follow at all times the
guidance of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.
There are many Ministerialists, and some of
them very clever men, who have lately been
proving that at times they would just as soon
vote against Arthur Balfour as with him. But
in regard to the Irish party and the members
who do not always fall in with the wish of its
leader, the actual facts are peculiar. The only
members of the party who have lately been
showing a tendency to mutiny are, with one
exception, men of no account whatever in Ireland's
political life. I do not wish to name any
names, but I can state with deliberation that
almost every one of the mutinous members just
now is a man who has not the slightest chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of ever again being sent to represent an Irish
constituency in the House of Commons. These
men have long since forfeited the confidence of
their constituents and their fellow-countrymen.
They are perfectly aware of this fact; they
know quite well that the next general election
will see them put out of Parliamentary life;
and, in despair of re-election, they probably think
that they might as well make the most of the
opportunity for rendering themselves conspicuous
or for indulging in eccentricities which now
can do them no further harm. It may be taken
for granted that at the next general election
the National constituencies of Ireland will send
to the House of Commons no men who are not
prepared to work in complete union with the
National party, and to recognize the authority
of the leader who has the confidence of his
people. I do not care to waste many words on
this subject, but I think it right to assure my
American readers that they need not attach
any serious importance to the doings of five or
six men, most of whom are either mere "cranks"
or are driven to desperation by disappointed
personal ambition.</p>

<p>John Redmond has the confidence of his
countrymen in England and Scotland, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as in Ireland, and we have seen that within the
last few months he has obtained full assurance
that he enjoys the confidence of his countrymen
in the United States, in Canada, and in
Australasia. I feel all the more ready to bear
my testimony to his merits and his success
because of the fact that I was, during a crisis
which lasted for some years, in direct opposition
to the policy which he felt himself conscientiously
bound to adopt. The change of events
has released him from any obligation to adhere
to such a policy, and I do him the justice to
believe that he accepted with the sincerest and
most disinterested good will the first genuine
opportunity offered for a complete reunion of
Irish Nationalists. John Redmond is still young
enough to have a career before him, and I feel
the fullest confidence in his future.</p>

<h2>SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT</h2>

<p class="p2">Every friend and admirer of Sir William
Harcourt must have been glad when it was
made known that the late leader of the Liberal
party in the House of Commons had declined
to accept the King's offer of a peerage and was
determined to remain in that representative
chamber where he had made his political name
and won his place of command. Sir William
Harcourt would have been thrown away in the
House of Lords. He could not have done
anything to arouse that apathetic chamber to
living importance in the affairs of state, and
the House of Commons would have lost its
most impressive figure. Sir William Harcourt's
political fame was made in the House of Commons,
and he is even yet its most distinguished
member. I say "even yet" because Harcourt
is growing old, and has passed that age of threescore
years and ten authoritatively set down as
the allotted space of man's life. But he shows
no appearance of old age, seems full of energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and vital power, and is as well able to command
the listening House of Commons by argumentative
speech and impressive declamation as he
was twenty years ago. Harcourt's bearing is
one of superabundant physical resources, and
he has a voice of resonant tone which imposes
no tax on the listening powers of the stranger
in the farthest gallery. He is a very tall man,
would be one of the tallest men in any political
assembly, and his presence is stately and commanding.
After Gladstone's death he became
the leader of the Liberal party in the House of
Commons, and he resigned that position only
because he could not cordially accept the policy
and plans of action undertaken by his leader
in the House of Lords, Lord Rosebery. I do
not propose to enter at any length into the
differences of opinion which separated these
two men, but it was generally understood that
Lord Rosebery did not see his way to carry
out Gladstone's policy for the maintenance of
Greece and the Christian populations generally
against the blood-stained domination of the
Ottoman power in the southeast of Europe.
The result of these differences was that Lord
Rosebery applied himself to form a Liberal
party of his own, which should be what is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Imperialist in its policy, and that Harcourt
became merely a member of the Liberal Opposition
in the House of Commons. To have
won the place of Liberal leader in the representative
chamber might well have satisfied the
ambition of any man, and to withdraw from
that place rather than contribute to any further
disagreement in the party did not in any sense
detract from Harcourt's influence and fame.</p>

<p>Sir William Harcourt won his earliest distinctions
in law and literature rather than in
politics. He comes of a family which has a
history of its own and had members who won
reputation during many generations. He was
educated at Cambridge University and obtained
high honors there. He was called to the bar
in 1854, and became Queen's Counsel in 1866.
In the meantime he had accomplished some
important literary work. He was a writer for
the "Saturday Review," then at the zenith of
its reputation, and under the title of "Historicus"
he contributed a series of letters on important
public subjects to the "Times" newspaper
which attracted universal attention, were
afterwards collected and published in a volume,
and found readers in every part of the world
where men take interest in the public life of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
England. He was a leading advocate in some
legal causes which excited the profound attention
of the whole country, and was already
regarded as a man of mark, who might be safely
assumed to have a successful career before him.
It was generally taken for granted at the time
that such a man was certain to seek and find a
place in the House of Commons, which of
course offers an opening for rising legal advocates
as well as for rising politicians. I can
remember quite distinctly that to all of us who
were watching the careers of promising men it
appeared quite certain that Harcourt was not
likely to content himself with professional distinction,
and that when he entered the House
of Commons he would devote himself for the
most part to the business of political life. He
made one unsuccessful attempt to obtain a seat
in the House of Commons as representative of
a Scottish constituency, and was more fortunate
in his second endeavor, when he was
elected to Parliament by the city of Oxford as
a Liberal in 1868. Then for a while I personally
lost sight of him, for towards the close of
that year I began a lengthened visit to the
United States, and only learned through the
newspapers that he was already winning marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
distinction as a Parliamentary debater. When
I returned to England in 1871, I found that
Harcourt was already regarded as certain to
hold high office in a Liberal administration.
His first step in that direction was to obtain
the office of Solicitor-General in Gladstone's
Government.</p>

<p>A story was told of Harcourt at the time&mdash;this
was in 1873&mdash;which I believe to be authentic
and is worth repeating. Up to this
time he was merely Mr. William Vernon Harcourt,
but the usage in Parliamentary life is
that the leading law officers of the Crown, the
Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General,
shall receive the honor of knighthood. It was
therefore a matter of course that Mr. Harcourt
should become Sir William Harcourt, and bear
the title by which he is still known everywhere.
The story goes, however, that Harcourt was
not much delighted with the offer of a distinction
which is commonly conferred upon the
mayors of English cities and towns and other
such personages of municipal position. Harcourt,
as I have said, came of a distinguished
English family which had contributed Lord
Chancellors and other such exalted dignitaries
to the business of the State. He probably had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
also in his mind the fact that rising men in his
own profession who happened to be sons of
peers were specially exempted by constitutional
usage from the necessity of putting up with
knighthood when accepting one of the two
legal offices under the Crown. The manner
in which this very fact proclaimed the comparative
insignificance of the title may have
still further influenced Harcourt's objections.
Anyhow, he did endeavor to impress upon
Gladstone his claim to be exempted from the
proffered dignity. Gladstone, however, assured
him that it was the recognized constitutional
practice to confer a knighthood upon a new
Solicitor-General, and that there was no reason
why Harcourt should seek dispensation from
the honor. "Then," demanded Harcourt&mdash;so
at least the story is told&mdash;"why don't you
confer knighthoods on all the members of your
Cabinet, and see how some of them would
receive the proposition?" I cannot vouch for
this story as historical truth, but I can vouch
for the fact that it was told everywhere at
the time, and received, so far as I know, no
contradiction.</p>

<p>Harcourt made his way almost at once to the
front rank of Parliamentary debaters. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
style was somewhat rhetorical and declamatory,
but it was distinctly argumentative, and his
speeches contained few passages of mere declamation.
He was a hard hitter, one of the
hardest in the House, but he hit straight from
the shoulder and never gave an unfair blow.
He was often very happy in his sarcastic touches,
and there was a certain robust and self-satisfied
good humor even in his severest attacks on his
Parliamentary opponents. The general impression
of observers at first was that Harcourt
would go in merely for the reputation of a
powerful debater in the House of Commons,
and would not show any ambition for the steady
and severe work of Ministerial office. The public
had yet to learn that the highest reputation
of the man was to be made by his success as
the head of a great Ministerial department.
Many observers also formed the opinion that
Harcourt had no clear political views of his
own, and was merely a sort of free lance ready
to accept employment under the most convenient
leader. He had entered the House of
Commons as a Liberal, and even before he
accepted office had always ranked himself as a
regular supporter of the Liberal party, but he
often made speeches in opposition to the views<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of extreme Liberals or Radicals&mdash;speeches
such as might well have been made by some
eloquent member of the Tory party. Many of
the more advanced Liberals had for some time
no confidence whatever in Harcourt's Liberalism,
and were often engaged in sharp controversy
with him. My own impression is that,
up to a certain period in his career, Harcourt
had not formed, or troubled himself to form,
any very settled opinions on the rising political
questions of the day. Upon all the old subjects
of political debate, on the controversies
which divided political parties in a former generation,
his views were, no doubt, quite settled,
but then there were many new subjects coming
up for discussion, bringing with them new
occasions for political division, and it is quite
probable that on some of these at least the
new Solicitor-General had not quite made up
his mind. He had been a close student at
Cambridge, and had been elected professor of
international law by that University; he had
practiced law as an advocate, and had begun to
make a reputation for himself as a writer. It
is quite probable that he had not yet given any
special attention to some of the new questions
which the growing development of social and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
political conditions was calling up for Parliamentary
consideration.</p>

<p>Harcourt appears to have accepted as a matter
of course, when he entered the House of
Commons, the recognized principles inherited
by the Liberal party. But there was then, as
at most other periods of England's constitutional
history, a new and advancing Liberal
party beginning to make its influence felt, and
not satisfied to abide by the mere traditions
and established canons of the older Liberalism.
Only a very few even of the advanced Liberals
were yet prepared to support and encourage the
Irish demand for Home Rule, and on such domestic
questions, for instance, as the regulation
of the liquor traffic, the Liberal party in general
had not made up its mind to any policy other
than a policy of mere inaction. I mention these
two subjects in particular because they have an
especial value in throwing light upon the change
which took place more lately in Harcourt's political
attitude. Probably at the time when he first
entered the House of Commons he had not
concerned himself much with the Home Rule
question, and had allowed himself to take it for
granted, as so many even among Liberal politicians
and newspapers would have told him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that the Irish Home Rulers were aiming at the
break-up of the Empire. In the same way it
is quite possible that he may have given little
or no attention to the demand for some new
regulation of the liquor traffic, and dismissed
the whole subject as a crotchet of Sir Wilfrid
Lawson. When, however, he began to study
the political life of the House of Commons as
an active and a rising member, and when he
found that his inclinations and his instincts
were leading him into politics and away from
law, we can easily understand that he set himself
to study with candid judgment the new
questions which were beginning to divide the
Liberal party. I have often heard Sir William
Harcourt accused of inconsistency and even of
time-serving, because of his sudden conversion
to the principle of some political movement
which was at last coming to be accepted by the
great Liberal leaders. I do not see any reason
whatever to believe that Harcourt can fairly be
reproached with inconsistency, or justly accused
of any ignoble motive for his adoption of the
newer and more advanced opinions. The explanation
seems to me quite clear. The university
student, the practicing advocate, the
professor of international law, adopted a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
career and devoted himself to an active part in
the work of the House of Commons. Then it
was that he studied for the first time with earnestness
and impartiality some great developing
questions which had previously been mere
names and shadows to him, and thus he came
to form the conclusions which guided his subsequent
career. If Harcourt had been thinking
chiefly of his own political advancement,
he might have done better for himself by
following the example of Disraeli, and taking
a place among the Tories, where intellect and
eloquence were more rare than on the other
side of the House, and where promotion was
therefore more easily to be won.</p>

<p>Harcourt had probably not given much attention
to great financial questions until he came
under the influence of Gladstone. Up to that
time he had, perhaps, not assumed that such
subjects were likely to come within the scope
of his practical work; but when he had to study
them, he began to discover that he had within
him the capacity for a thorough comprehension
of their real meaning and development,
and as the result of the study he became, when
the opportunity offered itself, one of the most
successful and enlightened financial Ministers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
of his time. In the same way he may never
have given any serious thought to the question
of Irish Home Rule, and may have fallen quietly
into the way of regarding it, in accordance with
the common opinion of most Englishmen just
then, as something naturally associated with a
rebellious desire for the breaking up of the
Empire. When, however, he was led to study
it as a question of reasonable import, he grew
to be a convinced and a hopeful advocate of
the cause. For a long time after he had
taken office under Gladstone he found himself
brought into an incessant opposition and even
antagonism to the small group of Irish members,
who then represented the Irish national
demand, and compelled to fight against the
obstruction which these Irish members were
raising night after night, as their only means
of enforcing public attention to a serious consideration
of Ireland's national complaints and
claims. He became converted to the cause of
Home Rule, just as Gladstone did, by having
the question forced upon his consideration, and
thus being compelled to ask himself whether
there was not some real sense of justice inspiring
the Irish agitation.</p>

<p>I shall always remember a conversation I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
once had with Gladstone on this subject of
Irish Home Rule. It was in one of the inner
lobbies of the House of Commons, and Mr.
Gladstone began it by asking me how I could
regard Home Rule as a national demand, seeing
that only a very small number of the Irish
representatives in the House were actively in
favor of such a measure. Gladstone called my
attention to the fact that out of the whole body
of Irish representatives elected by the constituencies
on the same basis of voting, less
than a dozen members declared themselves
uncompromising advocates of Home Rule. I
drew Gladstone's attention to the fact that
the suffrage in Ireland was so high and so
restricted that the whole bulk of the Irish
population were disqualified by law from giving
a vote at any election. Gladstone appealed to
me to say whether he had not long been in favor
of an expanded suffrage for the whole Kingdom,
and I told him that I cordially recognized
his sincere purpose, and that whenever we got
a really fair and popular suffrage he would
then find ample proof that the great bulk of
the Irish people were united in their demands
for Home Rule. Not long after, it came about
that Gladstone and his Government saw their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
way to a measure of reform which gave the
whole Kingdom an expanded and popular suffrage,
and at the next general election the great
majority of Irish members opposed to or lukewarm
about Home Rule disappeared altogether
from Parliament, and their places were taken
by avowed and uncompromising Home Rulers
elected mainly because they were earnest advocates
of Home Rule. Out of the hundred and
three members who constitute the Irish representation,
we had then nearly ninety who were
proclaimed and consistent Home Rulers. This
result did much of itself to make Gladstone a
convert to Home Rule, and it had naturally
the same effect on Harcourt, who was far
too intelligent a man not to accept the lesson
taught by the Irish constituencies, and to admit
that the demand for Home Rule was a genuine
national demand, and as such entitled to the
serious consideration of real statesmen. The
conversion of Harcourt I have always, therefore,
regarded as sincere and statesmanlike,
and of the same order as the conversion of
Gladstone himself. The first business of statesmanship
is to recognize established facts and
to act upon their evidence. Once the demand
had been proved to be national, neither Glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>stone
nor Harcourt was the man to deny it
a full consideration; and the same full consideration
made the one man and the other an
advocate of Home Rule.</p>

<p>In the days before the great constitutional
change which I have described, the change
which resulted in the adoption of a popular suffrage,
in the days when our small band of Irish
Nationalists was still doing battle inch by inch
against the Government, we had many fierce
struggles with Harcourt, then a leading member
of the Liberal administration. We had to
admit that we found in him a powerful antagonist.
He was ready in reply, resolute in maintaining
his position, and he gave us, to say the
least of it, as good as we brought. He was
ever alert, he could answer attack by attack,
he could carry the battle into the enemy's ranks,
and the ablest of our debaters had his best
work to do when compelled to stand up in
Parliamentary contest against Harcourt. But
I observed that in our private dealings with
Harcourt, on questions which came within the
range of his administrative functions, we always
found him considerate, kind, and even generous.
There were frequent occasions when a
Minister of the Crown had to be applied to by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
an Irish member for justice in the dealings of
his official department, where individual questions
of right and wrong having nothing to do
with the general subject of Home Rule came
up for consideration. I am now speaking of
questions which were not to be settled by mere
debate in the House of Commons, but which
belonged to the ordinary and practical dealings
of the department with this or that individual
case. I can remember many instances in which
I had to make some such appeal to Sir William
Harcourt, and I ever found him most ready and
willing to consider fairly the nature of any individual
grievance, and to prevent the administration
of the law from being perversely turned
into an engine of oppression. I know that
many of my colleagues as well as myself felt
thankful to Harcourt for his prompt interference
where a real grievance had been brought
under his notice, and for his resolve to see that
justice must be done to the obscure sufferer
from official tyranny. When the Liberal Government
and the Irish National party came
to work together for Home Rule, we, the Irish
National members, had nothing on our memory
which could prevent us from regarding Harcourt
as a genuine Liberal and a sincere friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
who had never shown any inclination to abuse
his power when he was strong and we were at
our weakest. My recollection of the days when
we were fighting against Harcourt is tinged
with no bitterness. He was always a formidable
fighter, but he fought fairly when he still had
to fight against us.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that Harcourt should
have been for some time regarded as a powerful
debater and nothing more. He was one of
the foremost debaters in the House of Commons,
even at a time when that House had
more commanding debaters in it than it can
claim to have just at present. He cannot be
ranked among the great orators of the House.
He is wanting in imagination, and without the
gift of imagination there cannot be eloquence
of the highest order. Even in the mere making
of phrases he has seldom shown originality,
and it has often been remarked of him, as it was
remarked by Disraeli of Sir Robert Peel, that
he never ventures on any quotation which has
not already well established its popularity. Sir
William Harcourt's best qualities as a speaker
consist in his clearness of exposition, his unfailing
fluency, his masterly array of forcible argument,
and the fact that he never allows his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
eloquence to soar over the heads of his audience.
I should be inclined to say of him that,
although he is unquestionably a great Parliamentary
debater, yet his intellectual capacity,
his faculty for balancing evidence, acquiring
and comparing facts, appreciating tendencies,
and coming to just conclusions, are greater
even than his powers of speech. I may say
that one who listened to Sir William Harcourt
during the earlier stages of his Parliamentary
career might very naturally have been led to
quite a different conclusion, and might have set
him down as a clever maker of speeches and
not a statesman. But such an observer, supposing
him to be endowed with a fair amount
of intelligence, would have gradually changed
his opinion as he followed Harcourt's political
career. Every time that Harcourt has been in
office he has more and more given proof that
there is in him the true quality of statesmanship.
He served as Home Secretary under
Gladstone, and was afterwards Chancellor of
the Exchequer, first in one of Gladstone's Administrations
and afterwards in the Government
of Lord Rosebery. There can be no question
that he proved himself to be one of the
greatest financial Ministers England has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
in recent times. His famous Death Duties
budget, introduced while Lord Rosebery was
Prime Minister, created one of the most vehement
controversies known to the political life
of the present generation. Yet the great principle
which Harcourt embodied in his dealing
with the question of death duties must now be
regarded even by his political opponents as
resting on a basis of absolute morality and
justice. The principle merely was that the
amount of taxation which any individual pays
to the State in consideration of his having
obtained property by bequest shall be greater
in proportion according as the acquired property
is great in amount. In other words,
Harcourt's policy maintained that a man who
comes in for a large property as a bequest shall
pay a larger proportion of taxation to the State
than a man who comes in for a small property,
and that the same principle ought to prevail
through our other systems of direct taxation.
The whole controversy simply turns on the
question whether the rich man ought or ought
not to pay a larger proportion of his income to
defray the national expenses than the poor man&mdash;whether
the citizen who has only income
enough to enable him to maintain his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
decently ought to be called upon to pay towards
the maintenance of the State on just the same
scale as that ordained for the man who can live
in lavish luxury. The boldness and originality
of Sir William Harcourt's venture in his budget
of 1893, the energy and argumentative
power with which he carried it to success, have
undoubtedly secured for him a place in the
front rank of England's financial Ministers.
The later years of Harcourt's career offer a
strange commentary on the estimate generally
formed of him when he began to be conspicuous
in Parliament. At the former period he
was commonly regarded as a clever but somewhat
superficial man, as one whose qualities
were rather flashy than sound, as a ready maker
of telling speeches designed to produce an
immediate effect and destined to be utterly
forgotten the day after to-morrow. Harcourt's
later years of public work have proved him to
be a serious Parliamentary leader, a man of
strong and deep convictions, a man who thinks
before he speaks and speaks because he thinks.</p>

<p>Indeed, the seriousness of Harcourt's convictions
on some subjects of national importance
has brought him more than once into disfavor
with his constituents. He holds very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and advanced views on the subject of local
option&mdash;that is to say, on the right of localities
to say whether they will or will not allow the
sale of intoxicating drinks within their confines,
and to state what conditions are to be
imposed on the traffic if it is permitted at all.
Sir William Harcourt went further on this
subject than some even among his colleagues
who were in favor of the general principle as
a principle, but did not see the necessity for
pressing it to immediate action. One of those
colleagues said to me that in his opinion Harcourt
might very well have allowed the question
to stand over for eight or ten years, and perhaps
by the end of that time the habits of the
population would have improved so far as to
render the passing of any strong restrictive
law unnecessary. I am quite certain that Harcourt's
earnest resolve to deal boldly with this
subject if he should be allowed the opportunity
had much to do with the condition of feeling
in the Liberal party which led to his resignation
of its leadership. We may look forward
with confidence to the formation of a new Liberal
Government in which Harcourt will have
a commanding position, and when that time
comes we may take it for granted that, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of whatever opposition on either side of the
House of Commons, he will once more attempt
to deal with the question of local option.</p>

<p>Most of my American readers know that Sir
William Harcourt's second wife was the daughter
of Lothrop Motley, the famous historian
who was for a time Minister to Great Britain,
and who died at Harcourt's country residence
in 1877. The eldest son, Louis Vernon Harcourt,
who was born in 1863, has also married
an American lady. Louis Harcourt, whom I
have known since his boyish days, is endowed
with much of his father's talents, and I have
always thought that if he had devoted himself
entirely to political life he might make for himself
such a career as his father has already accomplished.
During contested elections I have
been more than once associated with Louis
Harcourt in "stumping" some parts of the
country on behalf of the Liberal Government
then engaged in the cause of Home Rule, and
I have the clearest memories of his remarkable
organizing capacity, his ready eloquence, and
his skill in replying to questions and arguments
and in convincing skeptical voters. I take it
for granted that every one who has known
Louis, or, as he is commonly called, "Lulu"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Harcourt, must have delightful recollections of
his bright companionship. We have all heard
that Sir William Harcourt studiously consulted
his son when the offer of a peerage was made
to him by King Edward, and that "Lulu" was
resolute in supporting his father's desire to refuse
the honor, even although his acceptance
of it would have made "Lulu" the heir to a
peerage. Sir William Harcourt, we may well
hope, has yet good work to do in the House of
Commons. There is nothing about him which
suggests the idea of advanced years or of decaying
powers, whether mental or physical. The
curious attack of weakness which lately came
over so many members of the Liberal party
never touched his robust intellect and resolute
character. No man could render more valuable
services than he may be expected to do
in turning to account for genuine Liberalism
the reaction already beginning to set in against
the reign of the Tories and the Jingoes. I
cherish the belief that the best of Sir William
Harcourt's work is yet to be done by him.</p>

<h2>JAMES BRYCE</h2>

<p class="p2">James Bryce is universally recognized as one
of the intellectual forces in the British House of
Commons. When he rises to make a speech,
every one listens with the deepest interest, feeling
sure that some ideas and some instruction
are sure to come which no political party in the
House can well afford to lose. Some men in
the House of Commons have been orators and
nothing else; some have been orators and instructors
as well; some have been Parliamentary
debaters more or less capable; and a good
many have been bores. In every generation
there have been a few who are especially regarded
as illuminating forces. The House does
not think of measuring their influence by any
estimate of their greater or less capacity for
mere eloquence of expression. It values them
because of the lessons which they teach. To
this small order of members James Bryce undoubtedly
belongs. Now, I do not mean to
convey the idea that such men as these are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
usually endowed with the gift of eloquence, or
that they cannot deliver speeches which would
entitle them to a high rank among Parliamentary
debaters, no matter what the import of the
speeches might be. My object is to describe
a certain class of men whose Parliamentary
speeches are valued by members in general
without any special regard for their form, but
only with regard to their substance, for the
thoughts they utter and not for the manner
of the utterance. James Bryce would be considered
an effective and even a commanding
speaker in any public assembly, but nevertheless,
when the House of Commons and the public
think of his speeches, these are thought of
mainly for the truths they tell and the lessons
they convey, and not for any quality of mere
eloquence which adorns them. In a certain
sense James Bryce might be described as belonging
to that Parliamentary order in the
front of which John Morley stands just now;
but of course John Morley has thus far had
more administrative experience than James
Bryce, and has taken a more distinct place as
a Parliamentary and popular leader. Of both
men, however, I should be inclined to say that
their public speeches lose something of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
praise fairly due to them as mere displays of
eloquence, because of the importance we all
attach to their intellectual and educational influence.</p>

<p>I may say also that James Bryce is not first
and above all other things a public man and a
politician. He does not seem to have thought
of a Parliamentary career until after he had
won for himself a high and commanding position
as a writer of history. Bryce is by birth
an Irishman and belongs to that northern province
of Ireland which is peopled to a large
extent by Scottish immigrants. We are all
rather too apt to think of this Ulster province as
essentially un-Irish, or even anti-Irish in tone
and feeling, although some of the most extreme
among Irish Nationalists, men like John Mitchell
for instance, were born and brought up in
Ulster, and in more recent days some conspicuous
Home Rulers have sat in the House of
Commons as representatives of Ulster constituencies.
James Bryce has always been an Irish
Nationalist since he came into public life, and
has shown himself, whether in or out of political
office, a steady and consistent supporter of the
demand for Irish Home Rule. Indeed, I should
be well inclined to believe that a desire to ren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>der
some personal service in promoting the just
claims of Ireland for a better system of government
must have had much influence over Bryce's
decision to accept a seat in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Bryce began his education in the University
of Glasgow, from which he passed on to Oxford,
where he won many honors and has left
the memory of a most successful career, not
merely as student, but also as professor. He
studied for a while at Heidelberg, where he
cultivated to the full his previously acquired
knowledge of German; and I have heard in
later years on good authority that while Bryce
was a member of Mr. Gladstone's Government
he became a great favorite with Queen Victoria
because of his capacity for fluent speech in the
language which the late Queen loved especially
to hear. Before he turned his attention to active
political life Bryce studied for the bar,
became a member of the profession, and actually
practiced in the Law Courts for some
years. Thus far, however, he had hardly given
indication of the gifts which were destined to
secure for him a high and enduring place in
English literature. Thus far his life may be
regarded as that of a student and a scholar; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
had yet to give to the world the fruits of his
scholarship. James Bryce is probably above
all things a scholar. He is, I may venture to
say, the most scholarly man in the House of
Commons. I doubt whether there is in England
so widely read a man in all departments of literature,
art, and science as Bryce, now that Lord
Acton has been removed from us by death.
Long before his entrance into Parliamentary
life Bryce had obtained the highest distinction
as a writer of history. It is not too much to
say that his great historical work, "The Holy
Roman Empire," is destined to be an English
classic and a book for all countries and all
times. The author could hardly add to the
reputation he won by this masterpiece of historical
study, insight, and labor, but it is only
mere justice to say that every work of importance
which he afterwards gave to the world
has maintained his position in literature. His
turn of mind has been always that which
distinguishes the practical student&mdash;the student
of realities, not the visionary or the
dreamer, the man who, according to Goethe's
phrase, is occupied more by the physical than
by the metaphysical. In 1877 he published a
narrative of his travels in Transcaucasia, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
an account of his ascent of Mount Ararat. I
believe no other traveler has ever accomplished
such a practical study of Mount Ararat as that
which was made by Mr. Bryce, and during a
part of his explorings he was absolutely alone,
as he could not prevail upon the guides belonging
to that region to overcome their superstitious
dread of an intrusion on certain parts of
the mountain. He was always fond of travel,
and was able to bring some fresh ideas out of
places long familiar to tourists, and he gave to
the world in English periodicals the results of
his experiences as a traveler. His descriptions
of Icelandic scenery and of some rarely visited
regions of Hungary and of Poland have a genuine
literary as well as a genuine geographical
value.</p>

<p>His most important work, after his great
history of the Holy Roman Empire, is undoubtedly
his book on "The American Commonwealth,"
published in 1888. This work
has been read as generally and studied as
closely on the one side of the Atlantic as on
the other. I have heard it spoken of with as
thorough appreciation in New York, Boston,
and Washington as in London, Manchester,
and Liverpool. Many years have passed since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
an eminent English public man, not now
living, expressed to me an earnest wish that
some European writer would take up the
story of the great American Commonwealth
just where De Tocqueville left it in his "De
la Démocratie en Amérique." I joined cordially
in his ideas and his wishes, and we discussed
the qualifications of certain Englishmen
for the task if any of them could see his way
to undertake it, but neither of us seemed to
be quite satisfied that we had named the right
man for the work. At the time it did not
occur to either of us that the historian of
"The Holy Roman Empire" would be likely
to turn his attention to the story of the American
Commonwealth. Indeed, the two studies
seemed to me so entirely different and uncongenial
that if the name of James Bryce had
been suggested to me at the time I should
probably have put it aside without much hesitation.
One could hardly have looked for so
much versatility even in Mr. Bryce as to favor
the expectation that he could accomplish, with
something like equal success, two historical
works dealing with such totally different subjects
and requiring such different methods of
analysis and contemplation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>More lately still Mr. Bryce brought out his
"Impressions of South Africa." This book
was published in 1897, and the time of its
publication was most appropriate. It appeared
when the prospects of a war with the Transvaal
Republic were opening gloomily for the lovers
of peace and fair dealing in England. If Mr.
Bryce's impressions of South Africa could
only have been appreciated, and allowed to
have their just influence with the leaders of
the Conservative party at that critical time,
England might have been saved from a long
and futile war, and from much serious discredit
in the general opinion of the civilized world.
But if Bryce had spoken with the tongue of
an angel, he could not at such a time have
prevailed against the rising passion of Jingoism
and the overmastering influence of mining
speculators. It is only right to say that the
book was in no sense a mere distended political
pamphlet. It was not meant as a counterblast
to Jingoism, or as a glorification of the
Boer Republic. It was a fair and temperate
statement of the author's observations in South
Africa, and of the general conclusions to which
his experience and his study had brought him.
Bryce pointed out with perfect frankness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
defects and dangers he saw in the Boer system
of government, and even the most ferocious
Jingo could hardly have felt justified in describing
the author by that most terrible epithet,
a "pro-Boer." The warning which Bryce
gave, and gave in vain, to the English Government
and the English majority, was a
warning against the credulous acceptation of
one-sided testimony, against the fond belief
that the proclamation of Imperialism carried
with it the right to intervene in the affairs of
every foreign State, and against the theory
that troops and gold mines warrant any enterprise.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary career of James Bryce
began in 1880, when he was elected as Liberal
representative for a London constituency.
He did great work in the cause of national
education, and took an important part in two
State Commissions appointed to conduct inquiries
into the working of the public schools.
At a later period he was chosen to represent
a Scottish constituency, and when Mr. Gladstone
came into power as the head of a Government
Bryce received the important office
of Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. At
that time his chief, the Secretary for Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Affairs, was a member of the House of Lords,
and therefore the whole work of representing
the department in the House of Commons,
where alone any important debates on foreign
questions are conducted, fell on Mr. Bryce,
who had the entire conduct of such discussions
on behalf of the administration. The
department was one which gave an effective
opportunity for the display of Bryce's intimate
knowledge of foreign countries, and he
acquitted himself with all the success which
might have been expected from one of his
intellect, his experience, and his enlightened
views. Later still he became Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, and for the first time
had a seat in the Cabinet. The Chancellorship
of the Duchy of Lancaster is one of a
small order of English administrative offices
which have comparatively unimportant duties
attached to their special administration, and
leave the man in possession ample time to
lend his assistance, both in the Cabinet and
in the House of Commons, to all the great
public questions which occupy the attention of
the Government. In 1894 he became President
of the Board of Trade, one of the most important
positions in any administration. Bryce's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
official career came to a close for the present
when the Liberal party lost their majority in
the representative chamber, and the Conservatives
got into power and secured the administrative
position they are holding at the present
day. Nothing can be more certain than that
the first really Liberal administration which
is again formed will assign to Mr. Bryce one
of the highest places in its Cabinet and in
its work. Since he has come to sit on the
benches of Opposition he has taken part in
many great debates, and is always listened to
with the most profound attention. He is one
of the few leaders of the Liberal party who
were manful and outspoken in their opposition
to the policy which originated and carried on
the late South African war. He has taken a
conspicuous part in every debate upon subjects
of foreign policy, of national education,
and of political advancement. He has never
acted as a mere partisan, and his intervention
in debate is all the more influential as it is
well understood that he advocates a policy
because he believes it to be right and not because
of any effect it may have in bringing
himself and his Liberal colleagues back again
into power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>I have often noticed the effect produced in
the libraries and committee-rooms, in the rooms
assigned to those who dine and to those who
smoke, when the news is passed round that Mr.
Bryce is on his feet. A member who is reading
up some subject in the library, or writing
his letters in one of the lobbies, or enjoying
himself in a dining-hall or a smoking-room, is
not likely to hurry away from his occupation or
his enjoyment in order to rush into the debating
chamber merely because he is told that some
leading member of the Government or the Opposition
has just begun to address the House.
The man who is addressing an audience in the
debating chamber may hold an important office
in the Government or may have an important
place on the Front Bench of Opposition, but then
he may be a personage who feels bound to take
part in a debate merely because of the position
he holds, and every one knows in advance what
views he is certain to advocate and what line
of argument he is likely to adopt, and our reading
or dining or smoking friend may not think
that there is any pressing necessity for his presence
as a listener in the House. But there are
some leading men on both sides of Mr. Speaker
who are always sure to have something to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
which everybody wants to hear, and Mr. Bryce
is unquestionably one of that happily endowed
order. When the word goes round that Bryce is
up, everybody knows that something will be said
on which he cannot exactly calculate beforehand,
something to which it is important that
he should listen, and there is forthwith a rush
of members into the debating chamber. There
can hardly be a higher tribute to a man's importance
as a debater than the fact that his
rising to address the House creates such an
effect, and I have seen it created again and
again whenever the news went round that
"Bryce is on his legs." I have many a time
heard Conservative members murmur, in tones
not altogether expressing absolute satisfaction
at the disturbing information, "Bryce is up&mdash;I
must go in and hear what he has to say."
The tribute is all the higher in this case because
Bryce is not one of the showy and fascinating
debaters whom everybody wants to
listen to for the mere eloquence and fascination
of their oratorical displays. Everybody knows
that when he speaks it is because he has something
to say which ought to be spoken and
therefore ought to be heard. It is known that
Bryce will not make a speech merely because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
he thinks the time has come when some leader
of Opposition ought to take part in the debate,
if only to show that the Opposition is attending
to its business.</p>

<p>This command over the House Bryce has
always held since he became one of its members,
and no man can hold a more desirable
and a more honorable position. It is all the
more to his credit because he does not aim at
mere originality and never makes it a part of
his ambition to say something astonishing and
thus to excite and delight the mere curiosity of
his audience. There have been and still are
many members of the House who have made a
reputation of this kind and are therefore always
sure to command a full attendance merely because
everybody expects that when they rise to
their feet they are sure to make the House "sit
up," if I may use this somewhat colloquial, not
to say vulgar, phrase. Take such a man, for
instance, as the late John Arthur Roebuck, a
man of great intellect, master of a peculiar
style of eloquence, who made himself only too
often a splendid specimen of what might be
called in American phraseology "a crank." All
that could be said with certainty beforehand of
Roebuck was that whenever he rose to speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
he would say something calculated to startle or
to puzzle the House. There are men of the
same order, if not perhaps of quite the same
debating qualifications, in the House at present&mdash;men
who always draw a rush of members
when they rise to speak because nobody
can tell in advance what side they are likely to
advocate or what sort of bewildering paradox
they may set up and make interesting if not
convincing by the force of their peculiar style
of eloquence. Bryce is emphatically not a man
of this order. He is no lover of paradox; he
has no desire to create a sensation; he merely
wants to impress the House with what he believes
to be the truth, and his great quality is that
of a beacon and not of a flashlight. His arguments
appeal to the intellect and the reasoning
power; he speaks of what he knows; he has
large resources of thought, experience, and observation
to draw upon, and the listeners feel
convinced beforehand that he will tell them
something they did not know already, or will
put his case in some new and striking light.</p>

<p>The House of Commons well knows that it
would lose one of its most valuable instructors
if Bryce were no longer to occupy a place on
its benches or were to condemn himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
habitual inactivity and silence. When the Conservative
Government under Lord Salisbury
came into power, and more especially after the
late general election which brought them back
with added strength, many of the Liberal leaders
seemed to have grown weary of the political
struggle. Something worse than mere apathy
appeared to have set in, something more than
mere despondency and disheartenment. Men
on whom the Liberals of England had long
been wont to rely suddenly showed an apparent
loss of faith in all the proclaimed principles of
the party, and either relapsed into utter silence
or spoke in language which suggested an inclination
to cross over to the enemy's camp.
The two principal impulses to this mood of
mind were the South African war and the Irish
Home Rule question. The majority in the
constituencies had become inflamed with the
spirit of Jingoism, and could think of nothing
but the war and the Imperial glory of annexing
new territory. Feeble-hearted and weak-kneed
Liberals began to think that the party could
never hope for a return to power unless it too
could blow the Imperial trumpet. Other Liberals
made it manifest that they were becoming
alarmed by the unpopularity of the Home Rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
question, and were repenting the enthusiasm
which had carried them too far along the path
marked out by the genius and the patriotic
resolve of Gladstone. A species of dry-rot appeared
to have broken out in Liberalism. Before
long a new section of Liberalism was
formed, the principle of which appeared to be
that its members should call themselves Imperial
Liberals, and at the same time should support
the Tories on the only important questions
then under discussion&mdash;the policy of the South
African campaign and the Irish National claim
for Home Rule. Some of the men who had
held high office when Gladstone was in power,
who had made themselves conspicuous by the
ardor and the eloquence with which they supported
his policy of peace abroad and justice to
Ireland, now openly avowed their renunciation
of his great principles. There were others
among the foremost Liberals in the House of
Commons who, if they did not thus openly take
the renegade part, kept themselves quietly out
of the active political field and allowed the
movement of reaction to go on without a word
of protest. Three at least among the Liberal
leaders took a very different course. Three of
them, at least, not merely nailed their colors to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the mast, but stood resolutely in fighting attitude
beneath the colors and proved themselves
determined to maintain the struggle. These
three men were Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
John Morley, and James Bryce. There
were others, too, it must be said, who stood up
manfully with these three in defense of that
losing cause of Liberalism which they could
never be brought to regard as a lost cause.
But the dauntless three whom I have just mentioned
were the most prominent and the most
influential who went forth against that great
array of Toryism and Jingoism. Bryce was in
his place as regularly as ever during the whole
of that depressing time, and he never failed to
raise his voice when the occasion demanded his
intervention on behalf of the true principles
and practices of Liberalism. During that long,
dreary, and disheartening season when despondent
men were often disposed to ask whether
there was any longer a Liberal party, Bryce
made some of the ablest speeches he has ever
delivered in arraignment of the Jingo policy,
of the War Office maladministration, and the
rule of renewed coercion in Ireland. The Liberal
cause in England owes a debt that never
can be forgotten to the three men whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
named, for their unflinching resolve and activity
in the House of Commons; and of the three
none did better service than that which was
rendered by James Bryce.</p>

<p>Bryce has, in face and form, the characteristics
of a stalwart fighter. His forehead is high and
broad, with strongly marked eyebrows, straightly
drawn over deep and penetrating eyes. The
features are all finely modeled, the nose is
straight and statuesque, the hair is becoming
somewhat thinner and more gray than it was
when I first knew Mr. Bryce, but the mustache
and beard, although they too show some fading
in color, are still thick and strong as in that
past day. The face does not look Irish; its
expression is perhaps somewhat too sedate and
resolute; but on the other hand, it does not
seem quite Scotch, for there is at moments a
suggestion of dreaminess about it which we do
not usually associate with the shrewd North
Briton. Bryce is a man of the most genial
temperament, thoroughly companionable, and
capable of enjoying every influence that helps
to brighten existence. Always a student of
books and of men, he is never a recluse, and I
do not know of any one who seems to get more
out of life than does this philosophic historian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Bryce's London home is noted for its hospitality,
and his dinner parties and evening parties
give much delight to his large circle of friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryce are not lion-hunters, and
do not rate their friends according to the degree
of celebrity each may have obtained. But they
have no need to engage in a hunt after lions,
for the celebrities seek them out as a matter of
course, and I know of no London house where
one is more certain to meet distinguished men
and women from all parts of the civilized world.
Bryce's travels have made him acquainted with
interesting and eminent persons everywhere,
and an admission to his circle is naturally sought
by strangers who visit London. Representatives
of literature, science, and art, of scholarly
research, of political movement, and of traveled
experience are sure to be met with in the home
of the Bryces. I had the good fortune to meet
there, for the first time, many distinguished
men and women whose acquaintance it was a
high and memorable privilege to make. Among
Bryce's especial recreations is mountain-climbing,
and he was at one time President of the
Alpine Club. He can converse upon all subjects,
can give to every topic some illustration
from his own ideas and his own experiences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and the intelligent listener always finds that he
carries away something new and worthy of remembrance
from any talk with him. Although
his strong opinions and his earnest desire to
maintain what he believes to be the right side of
every great controversy have naturally brought
him into frequent antagonism with the representatives
of many an important case, I do not
know of any public man who has made fewer
enemies or who is more generally spoken of
with respect and admiration. A man must
have very high conceit indeed of his own knowledge
and his own judgment who does not feel
that he has a great deal to learn from conversation
with a master of so many subjects. Yet
Bryce never oppresses a listener, as some intellectual
leaders are apt to do, with a sense of
the listener's inferiority, and the least gifted
among us is encouraged to express himself
with frankness and freedom while discoursing
with Bryce on any question which happens to
come up. I think that among his many remarkable
qualities is that sincere belief which was
characteristic of Mr. Gladstone, and for which
Gladstone did not always get due credit&mdash;the
belief that every man, however moderate his
intellectual qualifications, has something to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
which the wisest would be the better for knowing.
We must all of us have met scholars and
thinkers and political leaders whose inborn
sense of their own capacity had an overbearing
and even oppressive effect on the ordinary
mortal, and made him shy of expressing himself
fully lest he should only be displaying his
ineptitude or his ignorance in such a presence.
But there is nothing of this to be observed in
the genial ways of James Bryce, and the listener
finds himself unconsciously brought for the
time to the level of the master and emboldened
to give free utterance to his own ideas and
opinions.</p>

<p>Bryce has been made a member of most of
the great intellectual and educational institutions
of the world, has held degrees and honors
of various kinds from the universities of Europe
and the United States, and could hardly travel
anywhere abroad or at home without finding
himself in recognized association with some
school of learning in every place where he
makes a stay. The freemasonry of intellect
and education all over the world gives him
rank among its members, and receives him
with a welcome recognition wherever he goes.
I presume that in the political sphere of action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
he is henceforward likely to find his congenial
career, but he must always have the knowledge
that, if for any reason he should give up his
political occupation, he can at any moment
return to some pursuit in which he has already
won an established fame. There are not many
political leaders of our time about whom the
same could fairly be said. For myself I may
frankly say that I hope James Bryce will henceforward
devote himself especially to that political
career in which he has accomplished such
great things. English public life cannot well
afford to lose his services just now or for some
time to come. A man who can bring to political
work such resources of thought and of
experience, who can look beneath the surface
and above the mere phrases and catchwords of
political parties, who can see that Liberalism
in its true sense must mean progress, and who
can at the same time see clearly for himself
what progress really means, and in what direction
and by what methods it is to be made&mdash;such
a man could ill be spared by the Liberalism
of our generation. The historical work he
has already done is, in its way, complete and
imperishable. But the Liberal party has yet
to recover its place and to regain the leadership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of England's political life. Every effort the
Conservatives in office have lately been making
to hold their full mastery over the country has
shown more and more clearly that they have
not kept up with the movements of thought
and are not able to understand the true requirements
of the time. On the other hand, the
limp and shattered condition of the existing
Liberal party only shows the absolute necessity
for the recognized leadership of men who
understand the difference between the work of
guiding the country and the ignoble function
of competing for power by imitation and by
compromise. In the new effort now so sorely
needed to create once more a true Liberal
party, the country requires, above all things
else, the constant service of such men as James
Bryce.</p>

<h2>HENRY CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN</h2>

<p class="p2">Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has but
lately come to hold that position in the House
of Commons and in the political world which
those who knew him well always believed him
destined to attain. He is now not merely the
nominal leader of the Liberal Opposition in
the House of Commons, but he is universally
regarded as one of the very small number of
men who could possibly be chosen for the
place. Sir William Harcourt and Mr. John
Morley are the only Liberal members of the
House who could compare with Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman for influence with the
Liberal party, the House of Commons, and the
general public. Yet the time is not far distant
when he was commonly regarded in the House
as a somewhat heavy, not to say stolid, man,
one of whom nothing better could be said than
that he would probably be capable of quiet,
steady work in some subordinate department.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
I remember well that when Campbell-Bannerman
was appointed Chief Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland in 1884, a witty Irish
member explained the appointment by the suggestion
that Gladstone had made use of Campbell-Bannerman
on the principle illustrated by
the employment of a sand-bag as part of the
defenses of a military fort. Campbell-Bannerman
has, in fact, none of the temperament which
makes a man anxious to display himself in
debate, and whenever, during his earlier years
of Parliamentary life, he delivered a speech in
the House of Commons, his desire seemed to
be to get through the task as quickly as possible
and be done with it. He appears to be a man
of a naturally reserved habit, with indeed something
of shyness about him, and a decided
capacity for silence wherever there is no pressing
occasion for speech, whether in public or in
private.</p>

<p>Many whom I knew were at one time inclined
to regard Campbell-Bannerman as a typical
specimen of his Scottish compatriots, who are
facetiously said to joke with difficulty. As a
matter of fact, Campbell-Bannerman has a keen
and delightful sense of humor, and can illustrate
the weakness of an opponent's case, better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
than some recognized wits could do, by a few
happy touches of sarcasm. He is in every sense
of the word a strong man, and, like some other
strong men, only seems to know his own
strength and to be capable of putting it into
action when hard fortune has brought him into
political difficulties through which it appears
well-nigh impossible that he can make his way.
Schiller's hero declares that it must be night
before his star can shine, and although Campbell-Bannerman
is not quite so poetic and picturesque
a figure as Wallenstein, yet I think
he might fairly comfort himself by some such
encouraging reflection. He had gone through
a long and hard-working career in the House
of Commons before the world came to know
anything of his strength, his judgment, and his
courage. He got his education at the University
of Glasgow and afterwards at Trinity
College, Cambridge, and he obtained a seat in
the House of Commons for a Scottish constituency
as a Liberal when he was still but a young
man. He has held various offices in Liberal
administrations. He was Secretary to the Admiralty
in 1882, and was Chief Secretary to the
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland for a short time a
little later. There is not much to be said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
his Irish administration. He governed the
country about as well as any English Minister
could have done under such conditions, for this
was before Gladstone and the Liberal party had
been converted to the principle of Home Rule
for Ireland; and, at all events, he made himself
agreeable to those Irishmen with whom he
came into contact by his unaffected manners
and his quiet good humor. When Gladstone
took office in 1886, Campbell-Bannerman became
Secretary for War, and he held the same
important position in Gladstone's Ministry of
1892.</p>

<p>The story of that administration tells of a
most important epoch in the career of Gladstone
and the fortunes of the Liberal party.
In 1893 Gladstone brought in his second Home
Rule measure for Ireland. His first measure
of Home Rule was introduced in 1886, and
was defeated in the House of Commons by
means of a coalition between the Liberal secessionists
and the Conservative Opposition. The
Liberal secessionists in the House of Commons,
as most of my readers will remember,
were led by Joseph Chamberlain. Then there
came an interval of Conservative government,
and when Gladstone returned to power in 1892<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
he introduced before long his second measure
of Home Rule. The second measure was in
many ways a distinct improvement on the first,
and in the meantime some of the Liberal secessionists,
including Sir George Trevelyan, whose
opposition was directed only against certain
parts of the first measure, had returned to their
allegiance and were ready to give Gladstone all
the support in their power for his second attempt.
The Home Rule measure was carried
through the House of Commons by what we
call a substantial although not a great majority,
and then it had to go to the House of Lords.
Everybody knew in advance what its fate must
be in the hereditary chamber. Every great
measure of genuine political reform is certain
to be rejected in the first instance by the House
of Lords. This is the old story, and is repeated
again and again with monotonous iteration.
The House of Lords always gives way in the
end, when the pressure of public opinion from
without makes it perilous for the hereditary
legislators to maintain their opposition. Therefore
the Liberals in general were not much
disconcerted by the defeat of the Home Rule
measure in the House of Lords. Home Rule
for Ireland had been sanctioned by the decisive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
vote of the House of Commons, and the general
impression was that it would only have to be
brought in again and perhaps again, according
to the usual process with all reform measures,
until the opposition of the Lords had been
completely borne down. But before the introduction
of the second Home Rule measure,
some events had taken place which made a
great change in the condition of Irish political
affairs and put fresh difficulties in the way of
Gladstone's new administration.</p>

<p>The Parnell divorce case came on, and led
to a serious division in the ranks of the Irish
National party and in Irish public opinion.
The great majority of Parnell's followers refused
to regard him as their leader any longer, and
those who determined to support him and to
follow him through thick and thin were but a
very small minority. Gladstone was firmly
convinced, as were the majority of the Irish
Nationalist members, that Parnell ought to
retire, for a time at least, from the leadership of
his party, if not indeed from public life, and
keep aloof from active politics until the scandal
of the divorce court should have been atoned
for by him and should have passed to some
extent from public memory. Gladstone was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
convinced that if Parnell remained the leader
of the Irish party it would be almost impossible
to arouse in the British constituencies any enthusiasm
in the cause of Home Rule strong
enough to bring back the Liberals to power
and to carry a Home Rule measure. This was
a reasonable and practical view of the question,
but Parnell and his followers resented it as a
positive insult, and Parnell issued a manifesto
denouncing Gladstone, the immediate result of
which was that break-up of the Home Rule
party I have already mentioned. Not very
long after came Parnell's early death. It may
well be supposed that such events as these
must have made a deep and discouraging impression
on Gladstone's hopes for the success
of the second Home Rule measure. The Irish
National party had been broken up for the time,
and some even of Gladstone's colleagues in
office had allowed themselves to be mastered
by the old familiar idea that as Irishmen could
not be brought to agree for long on any plan
of action, it was futile for English Liberals to
put themselves to any inconvenience for the
sake of an Irish National cause. Such men
might have found it difficult to point out any
great measure of political reform in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
concerning which the English people had always
been in absolute agreement and about
which there was no conflict of angry emotion
in any section of English representatives. But
the fact remained all the same that the dispute
in the Irish party had brought a chill to the
zeal of many influential English Liberals for
the Home Rule cause, and we have had in
much more recent days abundant evidence that
the chilling influence is with them still.</p>

<p>Among Gladstone's official colleagues there
were some who held that the time had come
when an appeal ought to be made to the country
by means of a dissolution and a general
election against the domination of the House
of Lords. This appears to have been the
opinion of Gladstone himself. Others of his
colleagues, however, held back from such an
issue, and contended that the moment did not
seem favorable for an appeal to the country
on the distinct question of Irish Home Rule.
The general impression on the public mind
was that the decision of the Cabinet was certain
to be in favor of an appeal to the country
on the one issue or the other, and much surprise
was felt when it began to be more and
more evident that the Government intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
go on with the ordinary business of the State,
as if nothing had happened. The outer world
has as yet had no means of knowing what the
reasons or the influences were which induced
Gladstone and his colleagues to come to this
determination. The whole truth will probably
never be known until John Morley's "Life of
Gladstone" shall make its appearance. We
may safely assume in the meantime that Gladstone
had the best of reasons for taking the
course which he adopted, and that he would
have made an appeal to the country against
the decision of the House of Lords if he had
believed the conditions were favorable for such
a challenge just then. Probably Gladstone
knew only too well that even among his own
colleagues there were some who were turning
cold upon the question of Home Rule, who
had never accepted his views on that subject
with whole-hearted willingness, and could not
have been relied upon as steadfast adherents in
the struggle. I think I shall be fully justified
by any revelations which history or biography
has yet to make, when I say that Campbell-Bannerman
was among those who would have
faithfully followed the great leader to the very
last in whatever struggle he had made up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
mind to engage. There were, of course, many
others of Gladstone's colleagues&mdash;men like
Sir William Harcourt and John Morley and
James Bryce&mdash;on whom their leader could
have safely reckoned for the same unswerving
fidelity and courage. But, whatever were the
reasons, there was no appeal made to the country,
and the administration went on with its
ordinary work in a dull, mechanical fashion.
The effect upon the Liberal party was most
depressing. Men could not understand why
nothing decisive had been done, and at the
same time were haunted by a foreboding that
some great change was impending over the
Liberal party.</p>

<p>The foreboding soon came to be justified.
On the 1st of March, 1894, Gladstone delivered
his last speech in the House of Commons.
The speech dealt with the action of the House
of Lords on a subject of comparatively slight
importance. The Lords had rejected a measure
dealing with the constitution of parish
councils, which had been passed by the House
of Commons. Gladstone spoke with severity
in condemnation of the course taken by the
House of Lords. Towards the close of his
speech he said: "My duty terminates with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
calling the attention of this House to a fact
which it is really impossible to set aside, that
we are considering a part&mdash;an essential and
inseparable part&mdash;of a question enormously
large, a question which has become profoundly
a truth, a question that will demand a settlement,
and must at an early date receive that
settlement, from the highest authority." No
one who was present in the House when this
declaration was made is ever likely to lose the
memory of the scene, although not all or even
most of those then present quite realized the full
significance of Gladstone's words. There were
many in the House who did not at once understand
that in the words I have quoted the
greatest Parliamentary leader of modern times
was speaking his farewell to public life. I
remember well that a few moments after Gladstone
had finished his speech I met John
Morley in one of the lobbies, and I asked him
if this was really to be taken as the close of
Gladstone's career, and he told me, with as
much composure as he could command, that
in that speech we had heard the last of Gladstone's
Parliamentary utterances. That was
indeed a memorable day in the history of Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>land,
and a day at least equally memorable in
the history of Ireland.</p>

<p>I have had to dwell for a while on these
historical facts, facts of course known already
to all my readers, as a prelude to the most
important passages in the Parliamentary career
of Campbell-Bannerman. When Gladstone resigned
office and withdrew from public life, the
question of reconstituting the Liberal administration
had to be taken into account. There
could be no doubt whatever that the Liberal
administration had been much weakened and
even discredited by the manner in which it had
put up with the domineering action of the
House of Lords. The effect on public opinion
was all the greater and the more disheartening
because it was generally understood that the
absence of any such action must have been
due to the fact that some of Gladstone's leading
colleagues were not prepared to sustain him
in the policy he was anxious to carry out.
There was therefore a state of something like
apathy in the minds of advanced Radicals with
regard to any arrangements which seemed likely
to be made for the reconstruction of the Ministry.
The new administration was formed
under the leadership of Lord Rosebery, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Prime Minister, in the House of Lords, and
that of Sir William Harcourt, as Chancellor of
the Exchequer, in the House of Commons.
There can be little doubt that the composition
of the new Ministry was regarded as unsatisfactory
by the more advanced Liberals in and
outside Parliament. The Liberal party is never
of late years quite content with an administration
which has its Prime Minister in the House
of Lords. The real work must always be done
in the House of Commons, and it is obviously
most inconvenient that the leader of the Government
should be one whose position will not
allow him to have a seat in the representative
chamber. The condition of things is something
like that of an army whose Commander-in-Chief
can never make his appearance in the
encampment or take part in any of the great
battles. Even at that time Lord Rosebery,
although a most brilliant debater and a capable
administrator, was beginning to be regarded
as one whose Liberalism was somewhat losing
color and whose whole heart was by no
means in the advanced policy of Gladstone.
There was nothing better to be done, however,
at the time than to make the most of the
altered conditions, and the new Ministry went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to work as well as it could. Campbell-Bannerman,
as Secretary for War, had an opportunity
of proving his genuine capacity for the duties
of his important office. He introduced a new
and complete scheme of army reform, which,
among other and even more important changes,
proposed to bring about the retirement of the
Duke of Cambridge from the post of Commander-in-Chief.
The Duke of Cambridge was
even then a man far advanced in years, who
had never in his life shown any real capacity
for the work of commanding an army, and
whose chief recommendation for so great a
position must have been found in the fact
that he was a member of the royal family.
The new measure was making its way steadily
enough through the House of Commons, and
every one was beginning to see that in Campbell-Bannerman
the country had found an administrator
of a very high order. Suddenly,
however, the progress of the measure was interrupted
by what seemed to be at first only a
trivial accident, of which the public in general
were inclined to take but little account. The
army reform scheme had arrived at what is
known as the committee stage of its progress.</p>

<p>I do not desire to occupy the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
my readers more than is actually necessary
with the mere technical details of Parliamentary
procedure, and I shall only explain that
when a Bill reaches the committee stage its
general principle must have been already accepted
by the majority in the House, and the
House then forms itself into Committee for
the purpose of discussing the mere details of
the proposed arrangements. During one of
the sittings a Conservative member proposed a
motion declaring that the Government, or at
least the War Office, had not made proper
provision for the supply of the material of
cordite to the army. This was so purely a
technical question, concerning which only soldiers
and scientific men could be supposed to
have had any means of forming an opinion,
that the House troubled itself very little about
the whole discussion. But when the House
came to take a division on the proposal, the
Government was defeated by a majority of
seven. This defeat produced at first only a
very slight effect on the House in general.
During the committee stage of a measure it is
quite a matter of ordinary occurrence that a
Ministry should be defeated on some question
of mere arrangement and detail, and very few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the House of Commons suspected on that occasion
that such a vote was likely to bring with it
an important Parliamentary crisis. Campbell-Bannerman,
however, took a very different view
of the event. He appears to have made up his
mind that the decision of the House was a
distinct vote of censure on his administration,
and that he could not continue to hold office
after so marked a declaration of disapproval.
Now, it may be taken for granted that Campbell-Bannerman
was not merely actuated by
any personal feeling, by any sense of mere
grievance to himself, when he made up his
mind to this resolve. He saw clearly that the
Government had lost the confidence and the
support of the country, and that the sooner
the whole futile attempt at administration under
such conditions came to an end the better it
would be for the business of the State. He
knew perfectly well that the Liberal administration
was falling to pieces, that its leading
members were no longer inspired alike by one
great policy, that some of its leaders had ceased
to be Liberals in the traditional meaning of
the word, and that sooner or later the catastrophe
must come. Those of Campbell-Bannerman's
colleagues who were as genuine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
stanch Liberals as he soon came into agreement
with him as to the course that ought to
be pursued, and it was known before long in
the House of Commons that the Liberal Ministers
had resigned their offices and that the
long-postponed appeal to the country was to be
made at last. Thus for the first time it became
known to the public that Campbell-Bannerman
was already a power in political life.</p>

<p>Parliament was dissolved and the appeal to
the country was made at the general election
which necessarily followed. Few Liberals had
the slightest doubt as to the result of the appeal.
Some of the very measures introduced
by the fallen Government which had the strong
approval of many advanced Liberals had put
certain powerful interests and classes against
those who represented this policy. Sir William
Harcourt's "death duties" had aroused the
indignation of rich men here, there, and everywhere.
The measures which the same statesman
had endeavored to carry for putting the
liquor trade under the control of "local option"
had turned the publicans into an organized opposition
against Liberal administrators. The
result of the general election was the defeat of
the Liberal party, and the formation of a Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>servative
Government with Lord Salisbury at
its head holding office as Prime Minister and
Foreign Secretary at once, and with Arthur
Balfour as First Lord of the Treasury and
leader of the House of Commons. The Liberals
were weakened in every sense, not merely
by the fact that they had come back to Parliament
no longer as a Government but only as
an Opposition. They were rendered by their
internal divisions too weak for effective work
as an Opposition. Lord Rosebery continued
for the time to act as leader of the Liberal
party, while Sir William Harcourt of course
became leader of the Opposition in the House
of Commons. It soon was quite clear that the
Liberal party could not work together so far
as its leaders were concerned. It was evident
that men like Harcourt and John Morley and
Campbell-Bannerman could not act in any
cordial union with Lord Rosebery and those
Liberals who accepted Lord Rosebery's policy.
The result of all this was that Lord Rosebery
resigned the leadership of the party and has
ever since seemed inclined to start a Liberal
party of his own, and that Sir William Harcourt
did not believe he was likely to receive such a
united support in the House of Commons as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
would enable him to maintain the leadership of
the party with any satisfaction to himself or the
country. Harcourt therefore ceased to hold
that position; and now came for the first time
the opportunity for Campbell-Bannerman. He
was chosen leader of the Liberal party in the
House of Commons, and he had before him,
under all the conditions, a task which might
well have seemed hopeless. Lord Rosebery has,
from that time to this, delivered speeches all
over the country which could only be interpreted
as the expression of his desire to call into being
a new Liberal party professing a political creed
differing in its main characteristics from that
which had been proclaimed and carried on by
Gladstone. Rosebery renounced Home Rule
for Ireland, and refused to act on Gladstone's
principles with regard to the protection of Christians
in the East against the alternating tyranny
and neglect of the Ottoman Government.</p>

<p>Never within my recollection had any leader
of a Liberal party in the House of Commons
come into a position of such difficulty and disheartenment
as that which Campbell-Bannerman
had now to maintain. It has often been
the lot of the Liberal party to come into the
House of Commons with diminished numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
and have to carry on as best it could be done
the battle against a Conservative Government
of overwhelming numerical strength. But the
peculiar trouble which beset Campbell-Bannerman
was that he could not count upon the allegiance
of all his nominal followers. He knew
that so long as he showed himself determined
to maintain the policy of Gladstone he could
reckon without fear on the support of such
men as Harcourt and John Morley and Bryce.
But there were able men among those who occupied
the front bench of Opposition on whom he
could not always count, men who were publicly
displaying themselves as the political associates
or followers of Lord Rosebery. Campbell-Bannerman
went boldly and steadfastly on, never
faltering in the least. He upheld the time-honored
creed of genuine Liberalism, "never
doubted clouds would break," and by his words
and his bearing inspired with fresh courage
many a true Liberal whose faith was not faltering,
but whose hopes were sinking low. He
proved himself quite equal to the incessant
work put upon him by his new position as
leader of the Liberal party in the House of
Commons. He developed a capacity for debate
which only those who knew him well had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
before believed him to possess. During all the
wild excitement of Jingoism which followed the
movements of the war against the two South
African Republics, he never yielded to the temptation
which overcame so many other Liberals,
the temptation to evade a passing unpopularity
by suppressing for the time his opinions on the
policy of the war. He must have been sorely
tried again and again by the sayings and doings
of some who still professed to be members of the
Liberal party in Parliament. A new Liberal
League was actually formed under the inspiration
of Lord Rosebery, and its object apparently
was to create a new school of Liberalism
which should have nothing to do with the traditions
of the party and with the doctrines of
men like Gladstone.</p>

<p>Now, if all this had been done in open and
avowed antagonism to the existing Liberal
party, Campbell-Bannerman might have had
a comparatively easy task to undertake. He
could have braced himself to do sturdy battle
against the promoters of internal disunion;
could have set the whole question plainly and
squarely before the Liberal public opinion of
the country, and demanded a decisive judgment.
But the promoters of the new Liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
League did nothing of the kind. They disclaimed
any intention to create disunion in the
party. They declared that they were the very
best of Liberals, and that nothing could exceed
their loyalty to the elected leaders of the Liberal
party, and protested that in whatever they
did they were only trying to help and not to
hinder the work of these leaders. When one of
the seceders, or supposed seceders, delivered a
speech at some public meeting in which he appeared
to repudiate the main principles of the
Liberal creed, and an open split in the party
seemed to be imminent, some other member of
the Liberal League hastened to explain that the
meaning of his noble friend or his right honorable
colleague had been totally misunderstood.
He insisted that the only motive of the previous
orator was to promote the cordial union of
the Liberal party, and, to paraphrase the words
of the medical student in "Pickwick" after his
quarrel with a fellow-student, that he rather
preferred Campbell-Bannerman to his own
brother.</p>

<p>Campbell-Bannerman took all these performances
with serene good humor. As I have
already said, those who know him are well
aware that he has a keen, quiet sense of humor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and I feel sure that he must often have been
much amused by the odd vagaries of those who
would neither fall into the ranks nor admit that
they wanted to keep out of the ranks. He has
gone steadily on as he began since it became
his duty to lead the Liberal Opposition in the
House of Commons. He has done the work
of leader honorably, patiently, consistently, and
fearlessly, and he is recognized as leader by all
true Liberals, English, Scotch, and Welsh. He
has never fallen away in the slightest degree
from the principles of Gladstone where Home
Rule and the other just claims of the Irish people
are concerned. He has kept the Liberal
flag flying, and the whole Liberalism of the
country is already beginning to rally round
him and to recognize his leadership. Increasing
responsibility has only developed in him
new capacity to maintain the responsible place.
We may well believe that he is destined to
do great service yet to the Liberal cause, and
to win an honorable place in British history.
When he first became leader of the Liberal
party in the House of Commons, he might
almost have seemed to be the leader of a lost
cause, but he has fought the fight bravely and
will see the victory before long.</p>

<p>"The writer who goes by the name of Mark Rutherford
is not the most popular novelist of his time by any means.
There are writers with names which that recluse genius
has never heard of, probably, whose stories give palpitations
to thousands of gentle souls, while his own are
quietly read by no more than as many hundreds. Yet his
publisher never announces a new story by the Author of
'Mark Rutherford's Autobiography,' and 'The Revolution
in Tanner's Lane,'&mdash;which we believe to be one of the
most remarkable bits of writing that these times can boast
of&mdash;without strongly exciting the interest of many who
know books as precious stones are known in Hatton
Garden.... 'Clara Hopgood' is entirely out of the
way of all existing schools of novel-writing.... Had
we to select a good illustration of 'Mark's way' as distinguished
from the way of modern storytellers in general,
we should point to the chapter in which Baruch visits his
son Benjamin in this narration. Nothing could be more
simple, nothing more perfect."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>
